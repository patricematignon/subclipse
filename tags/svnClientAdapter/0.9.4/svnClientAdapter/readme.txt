svnClientAdapter
===============

SVNClientAdapter uses javahl Subversion library (http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/subversion/bindings/java/javahl/) to provide access to the Subversion API.

svnClientAdapter is easier to use than SVNClient class and has more features.

There are not many junit tests in the sources. Most of them are with svnant.


How to use it :
=============
You will need to add svnClientAdapter.jar in your classpath. If you wish to use jni client (recommanded), you will need svnjavahl.jar in your
classpath too.

See the sample to see how to use it
