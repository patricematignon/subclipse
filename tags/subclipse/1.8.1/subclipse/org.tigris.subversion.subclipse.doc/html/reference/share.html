<h1>Share</h1>
<p>
    This function is initiated via the <span class="menu">Team &gt; Share </span> context
    menu.
</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    The share process allows you to add or identify your project to version control.
</p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>
    There are two scenarios for sharing a project. The first is the process of
    taking a brand new project in your Eclipse workspace and importing it into
    a repository so that it can be managed by SVN. This process is covered in
    the section that describes <a href="../gettingstarted/importing.html">importing a new project
    into a SVN repository</a>. The second scenario is where you already have
    an existing SVN working copy in your Eclipse workspace and you want to connect
    to using the SVN plug-in for Eclipse. This is covered in the section detailing <a href="../gettingstarted/share-existing.html">connecting
    to an existing project</a>.
