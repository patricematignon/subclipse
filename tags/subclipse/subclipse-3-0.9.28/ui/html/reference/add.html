<h1>Team > Add To Version Control</h1>

<p>When you share a project for the first time, or when you add or import new
resources to a project, you need to tell Subversion to keep it under version control.
To do this, use this command.</p>

<h2>Using this command</h2>
<p>First, find and select the resource(s) that you want to add. These will typically be decorated by a little question mark (TODO: image)
in the Navigator view.
You should only select resources currently not under Subversion's control, or this command will not be available.
Then, select "Add To Version Control" from the Team menu. The decoration will change to a tidy blue plus (TODO: show it).
<p>Note: If the resources parent folder is not under version control either, it will be added as well (all the way up to the
project root, as needed).
<p>Now your resource is scheduled for addition to the repository, and committing it will make it accessible to the other Team members.
<h2>If something goes wrong...</h2>
If you add something you didn't want to add anyway, don't panic. You can always undo (revert) your changes, by
selecting <a href="revert.html">Revert</a> in the Team menu. This is often prefferred over deleting the resource, since
if is only the 'added'-state that you revert, not the creation of the file itself. In other words, the file isn't deleted.
<p>TODO: Review if this should be moved to the tasks, since it does not contain any visible user interface. </p>
