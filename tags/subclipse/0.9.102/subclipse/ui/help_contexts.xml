  The topics are labelled so that the user can choose the "process" help (Tasks, Getting Started),
  or see the "Reference" sections. Also, the links are given in context, so that e.g. menu items
  are shown with menu ("Team -> Foo", not "Foo"), and SVN prefixes are always included
  ("SVN Resource History View", not "History View").

  The space should be adequate, since the pop-up can be as large as required. This is in contrast to the
  TOC files, where context is given already.
