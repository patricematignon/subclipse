<h1>Mark As Deleted </h1>
<p>
    This function is initiated via the <span class="menu">Team &gt; Mark As Deleted </span> context
    menu.
</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    Use this command to identify a missing resource as <em>to be deleted</em> to
    SVN.
</p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>
    Select the missing resource and choose <span class="menu">Mark As Deleted</span> from
    the <span class="menu">Team</span> context menu.  This option is only available in the
    Pending SVN Operations view.  This is due to the fact that the file does not exist, so it
    is not possible to select it in another view to perform an action on it.  Missing resources
    will also appear in the Synchronize View and the Commit Dialog and can be deleted on the fly
    as part of a commit.
