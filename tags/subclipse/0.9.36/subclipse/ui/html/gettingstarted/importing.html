<h1>Import a New Project into a Subversion Repository</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This is the process for taking a brand new project in your Eclipse workspace and importing
it into your repository so that it can be managed by Subversion.  If you have already been using
Subversion and you have an existing Subversion working copy in your Eclipse workspace that you
want to connect to Subclipse, then see <a href="share-existing.html">Connecting an Existing Project</a>.</p>
<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p>
Create a simple project that contains a few files so they can be stored in the Subversion Repository. 
A good test (since the wizard creates a lot of files) is to create a sample plug-in project by selecting <b>File>New>Project..</b> and <b>Plug-in Development>Plug-in Project</b>
Give the project a name and click through to finish on the wizard.
</p>
<p>
Next select the project you want to import and right click to select <b>Team &gt; Share Project...</b>.</p>

<p>This will begin the Share Project wizard. Select <b>SVN</b> as the repository type and click <b>next</b>.</p>

<p>If you have already defined the repository location you want to store this project in, then select it
in the list and click <B>Next</B>. Otherwise, select the Create a new repository location option and click
<B>Next</B>. If you need to create a location then see: <A
	href="new-location.html">Creating a new repository location</A> for more information.</p>
<img src="../images/share-module-name.jpg" alt="Select Folder Name">
<p>You must specify the folder name where you want to store the project. The folder name is relative to
the URL of the repository location you specified in the previous step. All intermediate folders must
already exist in the repository, but the final folder name must not already exist. You can use the
Browse .. button to select a path from within the repository. The Browse dialog also allows you to
create folders, so you could use that option to create any intermediate folders. In the above example,
we are going to follow the Subversion convention of storing the project in a ProjectName/trunk structure.
In this example, the ProjectName folder must already exist and the trunk folder must not exist. Click
<B>Next</B> or <B>Finish</B> when you are through.</p>

<p>The final page of the wizard is just a final confirmation page.  When you click finish, Subclipse
will issue the Subversion mkdir command to create an empty folder in the repository. It will then
checkout that folder on top of your local project.  This will create the .svn folder inside your
project, converting it into a valid Working Copy. Finally, Subclipse will then bring up the Commit
Dialog so that you can commit everything into the repository. You do not have to commit everything or
even anything. You may want to cancel the commit dialog and then go back to your workspace and do
everything from the Team menu. For example, if you wanted to set Subversion properties as part of the
commit, you would want to first use the <B>Team-&gt; Add to Version Control</B> option and then use
the <B>Team -&gt;Set Property</B> option etc. Once you have things the way you want them you can then
do <B>Team-&gt; Commit</B>.</p>
