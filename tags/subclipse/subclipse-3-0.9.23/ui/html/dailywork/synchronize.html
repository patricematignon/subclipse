	<h1>Using the synchronize view</h1>

	<p>The synchronize view is useful if you want to see the overall status of your
	working copy against the state of the repository, including any updates.
	The view focuses on inbound and outbound changes, where <em>inbound</em> changes
	are the changes that others have committed and are coming in to your working copy
	when synchronizing. The <em>outbound</em> changes are the ones you did to your
	repository as a result of editing, removing or adding resources.
	
	<p>In short, the synchronize view offers a different way of updating and commiting
	your work, and does so in a manner which <em>may</em> be more familar to you
	as an Eclipse user.
