  <p>This file selector is used to discriminate files within a fileset based on a Subversion 
  status. In particular, this selector keeps files that are recognized as 'deleted'.</p>
  
  <p>A 'deleted' file or directory is one that has been erased using Subversion's 'remove' 
  command. In general, <code>svn status</code> displays those items with the letter 
  <code>D</code> preceeding the name.</p>
  
  <p>It is important to note that a regular FileSet (the one supplied by ANT) can not detect 
  a deleted item, since it does not exist on the file system. To detect Subversion deleted 
  items, use the FileSet provided by svn-ant (svnFileSet).</p>
  
  <p>Example:</p>
  <p>to revert deleted files from a <b>workingcopy</b>:</p>
  
  <snippet type="xml">
    &lt;svn&gt;
        &lt;revert&gt;
            &lt;svnFileSet dir="workingcopy"&gt;
                &lt;svnDeleted/&gt;
            &lt;/svnFileSet&gt;
        &lt;/revert&gt;
    &lt;/svn&gt;
