  <p>This file selector is used to discriminate files within a fileset based on a Subversion 
  status. In particular, this selector keeps files that are recognized as 'added'.</p>
  
  <p>An 'added' file or directory is one that has been added to the repository, but not 
  yet commited. In general, <code>svn status</code> displays those items with the letter 
  <code>A</code> preceeding the name.</p>
  
  <p>Example:</p>
  <p>to copy a number of files with the status 'added' from their location in workingcopy 
  to a new directory called test, the following ant task can be used:</p>
  
  <snippet type="xml">
    &lt;copy todir="test"&gt;
        &lt;fileset dir="workingcopy"&gt;
            &lt;svnAdded/&gt;
        &lt;/fileset&gt;
    &lt;/copy&gt;
  </snippet>
