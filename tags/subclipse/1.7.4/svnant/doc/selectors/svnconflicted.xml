  <p>This file selector is used to discriminate files within a fileset based on a Subversion 
  status. In particular, this selector keeps files that are recognized as 'conflicted'.</p>
  
  <p>When updating a subversion item (file or directory), it is possible to have two sets of 
  changes merged into the working item. This happens when the item was modified locally as 
  well as remotely during the period since the last update. If the two sets of changes conflict 
  (same lines of a file changes, same directory entries modified), then the item is marked as 
  'conflicted'. In general, <b>svn status</b> displays 'conflicted' items with the letter C preceeding 
  the name. Note that 'conflicted' items are also considered 'modified'.</p>
  
  <p>Example:</p>
  <p>to copy a number of files with the status 'conflicted' from their location in <b>workingcopy</b> 
  to a new directory called <b>test</b>, the following ant task can be used:</p>
  
  <snippet type="xml">
    &lt;copy todir="test"&gt;
        &lt;fileset dir="workingcopy"&gt;
            &lt;svnConflicted/&gt;
        &lt;/fileset&gt;
    &lt;/copy&gt;
  </snippet>
