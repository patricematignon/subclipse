<h1>Mark Resolved</h1>
<p>
    This command is initiated via the <span class="menu">Team &gt; Mark resolved
    ... </span> menu option.
</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    Use this operation to mark a resource as complete when you are done resolving
        a merge conflict.
</p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>
    Several different operations can cause merge conflicts:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Updating your <a href="glossary.html#working">working copy</a> with changes
        to a resources which you have been editing (using <span class="menu">Team &gt; Update</span> or
        the <span class="name">Team Synchronization View</span>.)
    </li>
    <li>
        Explicitly merging between two repository URLs and/or revisions (using <span class="menu">Team &gt; Merge</span>)
    </li>
    <li>
        Switching your working copy from one repository location to anyther (using <span class="menu">Team &gt; Switch</span>)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    A <span class="action">merge</span> occurs for every inbound change to a
    resource which is also modified in the working copy. In some cases, if the
    local change and the incoming change intersect each other, SVN cannot merge
    these changes without intervention, and the file is marked as <em>conflicted</em>,
    and three files are created in the working copy. Here is an example of file
    in conflict:
</p>
<p>
    <img src="../images/mark-resolved.png" width="290" height="66">
</p>
<p>
    One file is the original version, before the update or other operation (.r10),
        one is the version you were working on (.mine), and the last one is the
        latest version from the repository (.r12).
</p>
<p>
    The resource itself is <em>marked-up</em> by SVN to contain all the conflicting
    bits in the same file, so you are able to correct the conflict yourself,
    as shown in this example:
</p>
<p>
    <span class="code"> if ((cartId != null) &amp;&amp; (customerId != null))
    {<br>
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Place the order<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IBuySpy.OrdersDB ordersDatabase = new IBuySpy.OrdersDB();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int orderId = ordersDatabase.PlaceOrder(customerId, cartId); <br>
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//Update labels to reflect the fact that the order has taken
place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Header.Text=&quot;Check Out Complete!&quot;; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Message.Text = &quot;&lt;b&gt;Your Order Number Is: &lt;/b&gt;&quot; +
orderId;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; .mine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Message.Text = Message.Text + &quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank
you. We appreciate your business.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;======= <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .r12<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Message.Text = Message.Text + &quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank
you for your custom!&lt;/em&gt;&quot;;<br>
    <br>
    } </span>
</p>
<p>
    Once the conflict is resolved (whether by hand or by using the <a href="edit-conflicts.html">three-way
    merge editing view</a>) you use the <span class="menu">Team &gt; Mark Resolved</span> operation
    to tell SVN that the conflict has been resolved.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        If you <span class="action">resolve</span> the conflict by <a href="revert.html">reverting</a> to
        the <a href="glossary.html#pristine">pristine</a> version, the conflict
        is automatically marked as resolved for you.
