<h1>Create Patch</h1>
<p>
    This command is initiated via the <span class="menu">Team &gt; Create Patch
    ... </span> menu option.
</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
    The content of the patch is determined by the scope of the resources selected
        with the <span class="menu">Team &gt; Create Patch...</span> option.
        The output of the Patch operation can be directed to either the clipboard,
        file system or saved in a workspace project. Clicking <span class="control">Next</span> will
        allow you to choose whether the Patch processing should recurse through
        subdirectories within your selection.
<p>
    Be aware that changes to binary files are never shown in the patch.  Also, in order to have new files included
    in the patch, you must first take the <a href="add.html">Team &gt; Add to Version Control option</a>.
