		<td>'svn' command line</td>
		<td>The "reference" implementation of the Subversion client is the command line </td>

		<td>Repository</td>
		<td>This is where your Subversion repository is stored and managed.</td>

	<tr>
		<td>trunk</td>
		<td>The trunk of the development is by convention where the mainline development takes place.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>	
		<td>branch</td>
		<td>Branches (typically from the trunk) are used when a separate line of development must be
		maintained. For instance, a released version with some occasional hotfixes could be a
		branch, the the next big version is developed in the trunk.
		Also, branches are typically used for long-term refactoring of the entire project which must be
		worked on by separate developers or teams.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>tag</td>
		<td>A tag is used to mark a specific revision for retrieval later on. Typically, you'd use
		a tag for every release or other important milestone, achieved by simple copying a repository
		path (e.g. the HEAD of trunk) to a name under the tags-directory.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>SVN</td>
		<td>'SVN' is the official abbreviation of Subversion</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>CVS</td>
		<td><b>C</b>oncurrent <b>V</b>ersions <b>S</b>ystem is the declared predecessor of Subversion.
		Subclipse is very much inspired by the CVS support in Eclipse</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>change set</td>
		<td>Some SCM systems have a very explicit notion of 'change sets'. In Subversion,
		a revision (or, typically, a range of revisions) is a change set, since it
		represents changes from one branch of development that may be applied to (merged with)
		other branches of development.</td>
