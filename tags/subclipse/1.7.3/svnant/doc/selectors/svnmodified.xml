  <p>This file selector is used to discriminate files within a fileset based on a Subversion 
  status. In particular, this selector keeps files that are recognized as 'modified'.</p>

  <p>A 'modified' file or directory is one that has been changed since the last update and 
  where the changes have not yet been commited to the repository. In general, <b>svn status</b> 
  display those items with the letter M preceeding the name. It is important to note that other 
  items can also be considered modified, such as conflicted ones.</p>

  <p>Example:</p>
  <p>to copy a number of files with the status 'modified' from their location in <b>workingcopy</b> 
  to a new directory called <b>test</b>, the following ant task can be used:</p>

  <snippet type="xml">
    &lt;copy todir="test"&gt;
        &lt;fileset dir="workingcopy"&gt;
            &lt;svnModified/&gt;
        &lt;/fileset&gt;
    &lt;/copy&gt;
  </snippet>
