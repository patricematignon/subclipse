<h1>Setting up a SVN Repository</h1>
<p>
    If you don't already have a SVN Repository set up you will need to create
        one using the svnadmin command. Creating a Repository and setting up
        network access is outside the scope of the Eclipse plug-in. For the purposes
        of this tutorial it is assumed that you already have a repository that
        you can access.

    Check out the book <a target="new" href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/"><em>Version
    Control with Subversion</em></a> for more details on setting up HTTP and
    other types of repository access. The book is also available in print.
