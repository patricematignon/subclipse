    <h1>XInclude Engine 1.0d11</h1>

    <p>
      These are three rudimentary
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude">XInclude</a>
      processors based on
      <a href="http://www.jdom.org/">JDOM</a>, SAX, and DOM2.
      These should work with Java 1.3 or later, and probably with Java 1.2,
      though you may have to recompile to get that to work.
      In a couple of places, I use the Collections API so if you're using Java 1.1,
      you'll need to install that and modify the source code as well.
      This version endeavors to support the September 17, 2002 Candidate Recommendation of XInclude
      though it falls short in a couple of areas, notably fallbacks and 
      XPointers.
      It consists of several classes:

      You can download an archive that includes the sources, the JAR file, support JARs,
      some simple test cases, the API docs, and so forth:

    </ul>
    
   <h2>Known Problems</h2>

    <p>
    On Windows 2000 with the Sun JDK 1.3.1 (and possibly other versions)
    resolving a master document using a 
    local file name relative to the current working directory fails.
    This isn't a problem with the XInclude code, but rather just a
    problem in the user interface when converting local file names like
    mybook.xml to URLs like file:/C:/books/mybook.xml. Everything should
    work as long as you use the full URL form. 
    </p>

    <p>
    URIs with fragment identifiers, particularly XPointers, are not
    yet handled. However, this would be a very obvious extension and would certainly
    give XPointer something to do. I plan to look into this.
    </p>

    <p>
    Namespace mappings in the included documents are not necessarily maintained.
    Currently this problem is hidden because only entire documents can be included.
    However, once XPointers are resolved, I'll need to address this as well.
    </p>


    <p>
    Fallbacks are not yet supported.
    </p>

    <p>
    Attribute types, most notably notations and unparsed entities, in the 
    included documents are not preserved.
    </p>

    <p>
    Xerces 1.3.1 and earlier have some bugs that prevent the DOM version
    from working. You'll need Xerces 1.4.0 to 1.4.3 or 2.0.2. 
    Xerces 1.4.4 reintroduces the bug.
    It should work with other
    DOM compliant parsers but I haven't tested it.
    </p>

   <p>
    Xerces 2.0.1  has some bugs that add extra comments from the external DTD 
    subset as part of the prolog. You should use Xerces 2.0.2 or later
    </p>


    <h2><a href="apidoc/index.html">API Documentation</a></h2>
    <h2><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xincluder/">Sourceforge Project Page</a></h2>
    
   <h2>Build notes</h2>
    
    <p>
      A build file for Ant 1.4.1 or later is included.
      The necessary libraries for JDOM and Xerces are in
      the lib directory. Assuming you have ant installed,
      you should be able to build everything just by typing "ant jar" 
      from inside the XInclude directory.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Install Notes</h2>

    <p>First you need to add the bundled 
    xincluder.jar file to your CLASSPATH.
    You'll also need to install a parser that support SAX2 and DOM2 in
    your CLASSPATH. The bundled xercesImpl-2.0.2.jar
    and xmlParserAPIs-2.0.2.jar in the libs directory will suffice.
    </p>
    
    <p>For JDOM, you also need to install <a href="http://www.jdom.org/">JDOM 1.0beta9</a>
    or later in your CLASSPATH. You probably need to get the latest version out of
    <a href="http://cvs.jdom.org/">CVS</a>. I've only tested it with 
    the current CVS version. The version I used is in the lib directory as
    jdom-1.0b9rc.jar. 
    </p>
    
   <h2>SAX XIncluder  Usage</h2>


    <p>You can process a file like this</p>

<p><tt>% java com.elharo.xml.xinclude.SAXXIncluder <i>filename.xml</i></tt></p>

<p>The processed file will be printed on <code>System.out</code>
and can be redirected into a file in the usual ways.
The original file is not changed.</p>

<p>You can also process a file at a URL like this</p>

<p><tt>% java com.elharo.xml.xinclude.SAXXIncluder <i>http://www.mysite.com/myfile.xml</i></tt></p>

<p>The processed file will be printed on <code>System.out</code>
and can be redirected into a file in the usual ways.
The original file is not changed.</p>


    <p>If you have the Apache XML Project's 
    <a href="http://xml.apache.org/dist/commons/">resolver classes</a>
      installed, then SAXXIncluder supports catalogs.
      Pass the fully-package qualified 
      name of the <code>EntityResolver</class> class
      after the -r command line option like this:
      </p>

<p><tt>% java -r org.apache.xml.resolver.tools.CatalogResolver com.elharo.xml.xinclude.SAXXIncluder <i>url</i></tt></p>

<p>XML catalogs are not yet supported for either JDOM or DOM.</p>


   <p>Finally, you can use this class from inside your own SAX programs
      through the <code>XIncludeFilter</code> which
      is an XML filter that
      resolves all XIncludes before passing them along to the client application.
            The <a href="docs">API documentation</a> may be helpful for this purpose.
      </p>

 
 <p>
  SAXXIncluder relies on the SAX2 XMLReaderFactory to locate a SAX parser.
  You can change the specific implementation in the usual way by setting the
  org.xml.sax.driver system property. 
</p>          
      
    <h2>DOMXIncluder Usage</h2>



    <p>You can process a file like this</p>

<p><tt>% java com.elharo.xml.xinclude.DOMXIncluder <i>filename.xml</i></tt></p>

<p>The processed file will be printed on <code>System.out</code>
and can be redirected into a file in the usual ways.
The original file is not changed.</p>

<p>You can also process a file at a URL like this</p>

<p><tt>% java com.elharo.xml.xinclude.DOMXIncluder <i>http://www.mysite.com/myfile.xml</i></tt></p>

   <p>Finally, you can use this class from inside your own programs
      to create unified <code>Document</code> or <code>Element</code>
      objects in which all XInclude references have been resolved.
      The <a href="apidoc/index.html">API documentation</a> may be helpful for this purpose.
      </p>
      
 <p>
  DOMXIncluder relies on JAXP to locate a DOM implementation.
  You can change the specific implementation in the usual ways.
  For example, to use GNU JAXP,
</p>     
  

<p><tt>% java -Djavax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory=gnu.xml.dom.JAXPFactory com.elharo.xml.xinclude.DOMXIncluder 
<i>http://www.mysite.com/myfile.xml</i></tt></p>

      

    <h2>JDOM XIncluder Usage</h2>


    <p>You can process a file like this</p>

<p><tt>% java com.elharo.xml.xinclude.JDOMXIncluder <i>filename.xml</i></tt></p>

<p>The processed file will be printed on <code>System.out</code>
and can be redirected into a file in the usual ways.
The original file is not changed.</p>

<p>You can also process a file at a URL like this</p>

<p><tt>% java com.elharo.xml.xinclude.JDOMXIncluder <i>http://www.mysite.com/myfile.xml</i></tt></p>

   <p>Finally, you can use this class from inside your own JDOM programs
      to create unified <code>Document</code> or <code>Element</code>
      objects in which all XInclude references have been resolved.
      The <a href="apidoc/index.html">API documentation</a> may be helpful for this purpose.
      </p>

   <h3>JDOM Notes</h3>

     <ul>
       <li>The inability to get the base URI of a <code>Document</code>
       hinders this</li>
       <li>The inability to get the line number of a particular element
       makes error reporting less useful.
       </li>
     </ul>

     <h2>Licenses</h2>
     
     <p>The lib directory contains two JAR files from the Apache XML Project,
     and one JAR file from the JDOM Project. 
     The build.xml file is based on the JDOM build file.
     otherwise, no source code has been used from either one.
     These are subject to the following licenses:
