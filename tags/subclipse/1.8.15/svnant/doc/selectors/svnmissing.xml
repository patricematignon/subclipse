  <p>This file selector is used to discriminate files within a fileset based on a Subversion 
  status. In particular, this selector keeps files that are recognized as 'missing'.</p>

  <p>A 'missing' file or directory is one that is managed by Subversion and has been deleted 
  without using the remove command. In general, <b>svn status</b> displays those items with the 
  exclamation point (!) preceeding the name.</p>

  <p>It is important to note that a regular FileSet (the one supplied by ANT) can not detect a 
  missing item, since it does not exist on the file system. To detect Subversion missing items, 
  use the FileSet provided by svn-ant (svnFileSet).</p>

  <p>Example:</p>
  <p>to delete missing files from the repository associated with a workingcopy:</p>
  
  <snippet type="xml">
    &lt;svn&gt;
        &lt;delete&gt;
            &lt;svnFileSet dir="workingcopy"&gt;
                &lt;svnMissing/&gt;
            &lt;/svnFileSet&gt;
        &lt;/delete&gt;
    &lt;/svn&gt;
