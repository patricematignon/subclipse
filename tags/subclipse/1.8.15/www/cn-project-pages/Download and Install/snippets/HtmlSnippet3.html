<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><p>Subclipse versions are tied to specific versions of the Subversion client API.&nbsp; So you must have a matching version of the Subversion client API (JavaHL) for your version of Subclipse.&nbsp; Any 1.x version of a Subversion client can talk to any 1.x version of a Subversion server, so generally the version does not matter too much.&nbsp; However, if you use multiple client tools on the same Subversion working copy, then it is important that the version of those clients is all the same.&nbsp; In addition, if you are on Linux, your distribution might only support a specific version of Subversion and JavaHL.&nbsp; So you might want to stick with a specific version of Subclipse for that client.</p><p><a href="/wiki/JavaHL">More information</a>  on how to get JavaHL, and the right version for each version of Subclipse can be found in <a href="/wiki/JavaHL">the wiki</a> .&nbsp;                                             </p>
