<h1>Team &gt; Apply Patch...</h1>

<p>This command (supplied by Eclipse, not part of Subclipse) applies a patch from a file in the local file system.
The expected file format is compatible with that of Subversion (and therefore Subclipse), or rather, the format
generated by the <tt>svn diff</tt> command is "unidiff" (by default) which is accepted by this command.</p>

<h3>See also:</h3>
<p>From the Eclipse CVS documentation: <a href="../../../org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/tasks-68c.htm">Working with patches</a></p>


<p>TODO: Review if this should be removed altogether, since it is more or less covered in "patches.html" in the "Tasks"-section.</p>
