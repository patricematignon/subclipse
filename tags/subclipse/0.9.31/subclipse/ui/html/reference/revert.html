<h1>Team &gt; Revert</h1>

<p>Whenever you have something that you wish you hadn't, consider choosing Revert from the Team menu.
In will revert the chosen resources to the pristine state, i.e. without your changes (and this doesn't require contacting the repository).</p>
<ul>
<li>Files will be reverted direcly from the pristine copy</li>
<li>Directories can also be reverted, but the revert dialog will in fact show the resources contained in the directory which have local changes,
and you can choose to revert these.</li></ul>

<blockquote><p>Note: Reverting changes can cause data loss, since it inself cannot be reverted unless you took some kind of backup copy yourself.</p></blockquote>
