<h1>Team &gt; Mark Resolved</h1>

<p>You use this operation when you are done resolving a merge conflict. Several different operations can cause merge conflicts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updating your working copy with changes to a resources which you have been editing (using Team &gt; Update or the Team Synchronization.)</li>
<li>Explicitly merging between two repository URLs and/or revisions (using Team &gt; Merge)</li>
<li>Switching your working copy from one repository location to anyther (using Team &gt; Switch)</li>
</ul>
<p>A 'merge' occurs whenever a change being pulled involves a resource which is also modified in the working copy. In some cases, if the local
change and the incoming change intersect each other, Subversion cannot merge these changes without human assistance, and the file is marked as
'conflicted', and three files are left in the directory: One being the original version, before the update (or other operation) changes, one is the one
you were working on, and the last one is the new version which Subversion tried to pull in.</p>
<p>The resource itself is edited by Subversion to contain all the conflicting bits in the same file, so you are able to correct the conflict yourself, as shown in this example:</p>
<blockquote><strong>After update of 'todo.txt':</strong><br><pre>
To do list
-------------
Mow the lawn
Prune the tree
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; .mine
Get rid of cat
=======
Buy new sofa
Find the lost rubber mouse
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .r1329
Attend dog's training classes
File tax returns
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Once the conflict is resolved (whether by hand or by using the <a href="edit-conflicts.html">three-way merge editing view</a>, you use the "Team &gt; Mark Resolved" operation 
to tell Subversion that the conflict has been resolved, and the "conflicted" marker disappears again (typically the resource is then either updated or unchanged).</p>
<blockquote>NOTE! If you resolve the conflict by <a href="revert.html">reverting</a> to the pristine version, the conflict is automatically marked as resolved for you.</blockquote>
