<p>This command brings up a dialog where you may select and deselect the resources you wish to commit, enter a message, and perform the commit against the repository.
The commit is relative to the resource(s) you have selected, and will list both modified, added, deleted and unknown resources (with the option to add them).</p>

<blockquote>Your working copy must be up-to-date with respect to the resources you are committing.
This is ensured by using <a href="update.html">Team &gt; Update</a>, just prior to committing, resolving conflicts and re-testing
as needed, as described in the <a href="../dailywork/workcycle.html">typical work cycle</a>.</blockquote>
