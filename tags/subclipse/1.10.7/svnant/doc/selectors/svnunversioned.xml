  <p>This file selector is used to discriminate files within a fileset based on a Subversion 
  status. In particular, this selector keeps files that are recognized as 'unversioned'.</p>
  
  <p>An 'unversioned' file or directory is one that is present in a working copy but is not 
  yet known to the repository. In general, <b>svn status</b> display those items with a question 
  mark (?) preceeding the name. Note that 'ignored' items are not considered 'unversioned'.</p>
  
  <p>Example:</p>
  <p>to copy a number of files with the status 'unversioned' from their location in <b>workingcopy</b>
  to a new directory called <b>test</b>, the following ant task can be used:</p>
  
  <snippet type="xml">
    &lt;copy todir="test"&gt;
        &lt;fileset dir="workingcopy"&gt;
            &lt;svnUnversioned/&gt;
        &lt;/fileset&gt;
    &lt;/copy&gt;
  </snippet>
