  <p>This file selector is used to discriminate files within a fileset based on a 
  Subversion status. In particular, this selector keeps files that are recognized as 'ignored'.</p>

  <p>An 'ignored' file or directory is one which name match the patterns found in the parent 
  directory's <b>svn:ignore</b> property. In general, <b>svn status --no-ignore</b> display 
  those items with the letter I preceeding the name.</p>

  <p>Example:</p>
  <p>to copy a number of files with the status 'ignored' from their location in <b>workingcopy</b>
  to a new directory called <b>test</b>, the following ant task can be used:</p>

  <snippet type="xml">
    &lt;copy todir="test"&gt;
        &lt;fileset dir="workingcopy"&gt;
            &lt;svnIgnored/&gt;
        &lt;/fileset&gt;
    &lt;/copy&gt;
  </snippet>
