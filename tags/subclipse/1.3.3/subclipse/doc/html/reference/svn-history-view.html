<h1>History View</h1>
<p>
    This view is accessed via the <span class="menu">Team &gt; Show History</span>
    context menu.  Subclipse is using the common Team History view and framework provided
    by Eclipse.  Another way to activate this view is to choose <span class="menu">Window &gt; Show
    View &gt; Other...</span> and select <span class="name">Team</span> ... <span class="name">
    History</span>.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
    This view shows the history of a selected resource, as it exists in the SVN
        repository. In SVN, both files and directories are versioned and have
        a history. If the resource selected is in a <a href="glossary.html#working">working
        copy</a>, the revision currently checked out is highlighted (in bold
        face).
<p>
    The view itself consists of three distinct areas:
<ul>
    <li>
        The revision table showing revision numbers, date/time of revision, the
            name of the author, as well as the first line of the commit message.
            You can click on any revision to show its full details.
    </li>
    <li>
        The list of resources affected by this revision (modified, added, deleted
            or changed properties).
    </li>
    <li>
        The commit message for the selected revision.

<dl>
    <dt><img src="../images/nav-refresh.png" width="23" height="22"/> Refresh </dt>

        By default, the resource history view only loads the revision table with
            the latest revisions. The number of revisions returned is
            set in the SVN preferences. This command retrieves the next block
            of revisions from the repository.
    </dd>
    <dt><img src="../images/nav-getall.png" width="23" height="22"> Get All</dt>
    <dd>
        This command will retrieve all revisions from the repository for the
            selected resource.
    </dd>
    <dt><img src="../images/btn-linktoeditor.png" width="23" height="22"> Link
        with Editor</dt>
    <dd>
        The <span class="name">History View</span> can be linked
        with the current editor. If linked, the content if the revision table
        changes when you switch the resource being edited. Showing resource history
        may be a longer running operation since it must retrieve the history
        from the repository. If working with a remote repository on a WAN or
        on the internet, you might want to turn off the "Link with Editor" button,
        or explicitly close or hide the view when switching between resources
        in the editor.
    </dd>
    <dt><img src="../images/btn-options.png" width="18" height="22"> Options</dt>
    <dd>
        This command displays a menu of <a href="resource-history-view-options.html">view
        options</a> to control the behaviour and display of the <span class="name">

</dl>
<h2>Context menu</h2>
<p>
    The context menu is available for any item listed in the revision table.
</p>
<p>
    The menu options available on the context menu vary depending on whether
        you launched the resource history view from your working copy or the <span class="name">SVN
        Repository View.</span>
</p>
<h3>Get Contents</h3>
<p>
    Use this option to update the contents of the selected file in your working
        copy with the contents of the revision in the repository. The revision
        number of your local file is not changed by this option.
</p>
<p>
    This option is only valid when the resource history was launched for an individual
        file in a local working copy.
</p>
<h3>Get Revision </h3>
<p>
    Use this option to replace the file in your working copy with the selected
        revision in the repository. The revision number of your local file is
        changed to the selected revision.

<p>
    This option is only valid when the resource history was launched for an individual
        file in a local working copy.
</p>
<h3>Create Unified Diff </h3>
<p>
    This menu option will create an output file of the changes in the selected
        revision in <a href="glossary.html#unified">unified diff</a> format.

        revision.

</p>
<h3>Show Annotation</h3>
<p>
    This option launches the <span class="name">SVN Annotate View</span> for
    the selected file. The <a href="svn-annotations.html">annotate view</a> allows

    in a file.
