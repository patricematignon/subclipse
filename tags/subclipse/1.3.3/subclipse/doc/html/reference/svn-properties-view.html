<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
    The SVN Properties View lists all of the SVN properties associated with a
        selected resource and allows you to add, modify and delete them.
</p>
<p>
    In general, properties are just name/value pairs that mean something to the
        specific usage of the repository. However, some special properties have
        explicit meaning to SVN itself and to user interface agents like the
        SVN plug-in for Eclipse. Properties are versioned data in their own right
        so if you change a property, you need to commit it to the repository
        before others can see it.
</p>
<h2> Context Menu</h2>
<h3>Refresh View </h3>
<p>
    Refresh the SVN Properties View and update the display with the latest information
        from the repository.
</p>
<h3> Add / Modify a property</h3>
<p>
    This option launches the <a href="set-property.html">Set a SVN Property</a> dialog.
</p>
<h3> Save property value</h3>
<p>
    Allows you to save the property value to a file within the current or an
    alternative project.
</p>
<h3> Delete Property</h3>
<p>
    Deletes the property pair from the selected resource. Confirmation is requested
        before actioning the delete request.
