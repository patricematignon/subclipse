<h1>Connect an Existing Project with SVN</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    This is the process for taking an existing <a href="../reference/glossary.html#working">working
    copy</a> that exists in your workspace and connecting it to SVN. If you have
    a brand new project that you want to import into your repository, then see
    the section on <a href="importing.html">Importing a new Project into a SVN
    Repository</a>.
</p>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>
    This procedure assumes that you have an existing project in your workspace
    and that project is already a valid working copy.
</p>
<p>
    Select the project you want to connect with SVN and right click to select <span class="menu">Team &gt; Share
    Project...</span>
</p>
<p>
    <img src="../images/share-provider.png" width="461" height="415">
</p>
<p>
    This will begin the <span class="name">Share Project</span> wizard. Select <span class="name">SVN</span> as
    the repository type and click <span class="control">Next</span>.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    The wizard will check for valid .svn metadata folders in the root of the
        project you originally selected to share. If it finds those folders,
        then you will see a screen like the one above. If you do not see this
        screen, and instead see the screen that you would see when this is a
        new project, then you should cancel the wizard. This would mean that
        the wizard did not recognize this as an existing working copy. If you
        continue, the wizard will treat this like a new project to import into
        your repository. Otherwise, assuming that you do see the above screen,
        just click <span class="control">Finish</span> to connect the project
        with SVN. The wizard will complete the process by launching the commit
        dialog to commit any locally modified files. You can cancel the dialog
        if you do not want to commit anything at this time.
