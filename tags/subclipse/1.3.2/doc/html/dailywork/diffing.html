	<h1>Comparing, QuickDiff and Restoring</h1>

	<p>Often, you want to see what actual changes you have done. To do this, you
	can use the "Compare With" and QuickDiff functions.
	
	<h2>Setting the QuickDiff provider</h2>
	It's as easy as right-clicking in the QuickDiff marker line to the immediate left of Eclipse's
	text editor(s).

	<p>Now, you can just hover the mouse over the QuickDiff marker line to see what was changed
	locally.</p>
	
	<p>To set this permanently, you may use the Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Workbench &gt; Editors &gt; QuickDiff page,
	where you can select the "Pristine SVN Copy" in the QuickDiff reference list box:</p>
