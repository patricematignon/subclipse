<h1>Creating and applying patches</h1>
<h2> Overview</h2>
<p>
    Often, when work on a project is shared between many developers, you need
        to work with, review and mabye transfer changes that haven't been committed
        yet. To help with with process, SVN provides the functionality to <a href="../reference/create-patch.html">create
        a patch</a>, which works with Eclipse's built-in ability to <a href="../reference/apply-patch.html">apply
        a patch</a>.
<p>
    Patches are representations of changes to a given version of the repository
        state, and can easily be transferred to other developers; for example,
        when one developer (who doesn't have commit access) needs to submit a
        change to someone who can then review and commit it.
</p>
<h2>Creating a patch</h2>
<p>
    Select your project or a folder/file and take the <span class="menu">Team &gt; Create
    patch...</span> option. Save the patch to a file and distribute the file
    via email or whatever mechanism is appropriate.
</p>

    have new files included in your patch you must use the <a href="../reference/add.html">Team &gt; Add
    to Version Control</a> option prior to creating the patch. This will tell
    SVN to include it in the patch.
</p>
<h2>Applying a patch</h2>
<p>
    Select the project or a folder/file and take the <span class="menu">Team &gt; Apply
    patch...</span> option. This will walk you through a wizard that lets you
    specify the patch location and then apply it to your working copy.
