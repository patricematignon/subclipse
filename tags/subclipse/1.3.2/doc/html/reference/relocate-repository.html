<h1>Relocate Repository </h1>
<p>
    This dialog is accessed via the <span class="menu">Relocate </span> context
    menu from the <a href="svn-repository-view.html">SVN Repository View</a>.
</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    The relocate option exists for one reason, and that is to update the URL
        of your repository when it is moved to a new server or you change the
        access method, such as from http:// to https://. When you take the option
        it updates the URL in the repository view, and then runs the switch --relocate
        command on all of the projects in your workspace that are connected to
        this repository location.
</p>
<h2>Process</h2>

    The first page of the wizard contains some standard warning text about what
        the option will do, but the main thing it is showing you is all of the
        projects in your workspace that is going to update. This is purely informational,
        you cannot choose to not update any of the projects.

    The next and final page of the wizard shows you the current repository URL
        and allows you to provide a new URL. The new URL should be pointing to
        the same relative location within the repository. In other words, you
        should only be changing something like the access method (http://), or
        the port number, or the host name.
