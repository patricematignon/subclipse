<h1>Search SVN Resource History</h1>
<p>
    The history can be searched from the SVN Resource History View using the <span class="menu">Find</span>
        button or by pressing <span class="control">Ctrl+F</span> when the History View
        is selected.
</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    Browsing the history of a resource gives a good overview of changes made to it.
        Using the search functionality of the <a href="svn-history-view.html">SVN Resource History View</a>
        specific logs can be filtered. The search is performed on the fetched entries
        in the history view. It is possible to have the search fetch additional logs
        matching the period in which to search.
</p>
<h2>Process</h2>

</p>
<p>
    In the search dialog the selected resource is displayed. This resource is the
        same as the one for which logs are displayed in the history view. By enabling
        special characters it is possible to search with very basic pattern matching.
        The special characters can be used in the author field and the comment field.
</p>
<p>
    The comment combo box keeps a list of previous searched comments in this Eclipse
        session. Searching all logs results in searching all fetched logs. When the
        option is enabled for automatically fetching additional logs the search all option
        results in fetching all logs for the selected resource. This operation might take some
        time.
</p>
<p>
    When the option for searching all logs is disabled a start and end date can be given
        to select a search period. When the option for automatically fetching logs is
        selected the search process fetches logs up to the start date given. It fetches
        logs just like the <span class="control">Next</span> action of the history view.
</p>
<p>
    Click <span class="control">OK</span> to search the logs with the given criteria.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        A combination of searching all logs and automatically fetching additional logs 
            results in fetching all logs of the selected resource. This operation might take
            some time.
    </p>
