<h1>Switch</h1>
<p>
    This function is initiated via the <span class="menu">Team &gt; Switch </span> menu
    option.
</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    While a check out operation checks out everything from the desired branch
        into a new <a href="glossary.html#working">working copy</a>, a <span class=name>switch</span> operation
        only transfers the changed data to an existing working copy. This can
        considerably reduce the amount of time it takes to establish the desired
        working copy as well as dramtically reduce the load on the network during
        the copy process.

<p>
    Type the URL of the desired repository location (usually a branch) or click <span class="control">Browse</span> to
    select a location from the repository. Click <span class="control">OK</span> to
    switch your working copy to the new location.

<blockquote>
    <p>
        Switch works just like <a href="update.html">Update</a> in that it never
        discards your local changes. Any changes you have made to your working
        copy which have not yet been committed will be merged when you do the
        Switch. If you do not want this to happen, you must either commit your
        changes before switching, or <a href="revert.html">Revert</a> your working
        copy to an already-committed revision (typically HEAD).
    </p>
