  <p>This file selector is used to discriminate files within a fileset based on a 
  Subversion status. In particular, this selector keeps files that are recognized 
  as 'replaced'.</p>

  <p>A 'replaced' file or directory is one that has been deleted, then created anew and finally 
  added back to the repository. Also, those changes must not have been comitted. In general, 
  <b>svn status</b> displays those items with the letter R preceeding the name.</p>

  <p>Example:</p>
  <p>to copy a number of files with the status 'replaced' from their location in <b>workingcopy</b> 
  to a new directory called <b>test</b>, the following ant task can be used:</p>
  
  <snippet type="xml">
    &lt;copy todir="test"&gt;
        &lt;fileset dir="workingcopy"&gt;
            &lt;svnReplaced/&gt;
        &lt;/fileset&gt;
    &lt;/copy&gt;
  </snippet>
