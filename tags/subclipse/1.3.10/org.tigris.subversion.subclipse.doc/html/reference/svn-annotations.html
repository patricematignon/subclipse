<h2>Functions</h2>
<p>
    The <span class="name">SVN Annotate View</span> is part of the <span class="name"><a href="svn-repository.html">SVN
    Repository Exploring Perspective</a></span> and allows you to review the
    revision history for a specifc file, right down to the individual line of
    code.
</p>
<p>
    The view is comprised of three distinct areas:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The first pane shows a list of all the individuals that have changed
            this file along with the revision number and the total number of
            lines changed as part of that revision.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Eclipse text viewer showing the contents of the selected file at
            the <a href="glossary.html#head">head</a> revision.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <a href="svn-history-view.html"><span class="name">History
        View</span></a> for the selected file.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The <span class="name">History View</span> and the view of the
    file contents are dynamically linked to the revision panel. <span class="action">Left
    clicking</span> an entry in the revision pane will highlight all of the lines
    that were modified in the file in the text viewer. In the same way, when
    a line in the text viewer is selected, the revision author will be highlighted
    in the revision pane. The <span class="name">History View</span> is
    automatically updated to provide the full details of each revision selected.
