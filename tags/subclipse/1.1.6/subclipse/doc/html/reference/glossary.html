  <dt><a name="branch">Branch</a></dt>
  <dd>A branch is an offshoot of mainline development typically used to isolate
    long running changes or manage multiple versions or releases of an application
    codeline.</dd>
  <dt><a name="changeset"></a>Changeset</dt>
  <dd>
      Some SCM systems have a very explicit notion of 'change sets'. In SVN,
      a revision (or, typically, a range of revisions) is a change set, since
      it represents changes from one branch of development that may be applied
    to (merged with) other branches of development.  </dd>
  <dt><a name="head">Head</a></dt>
  <dd> The head revision, or latest version, of a resource.</dd>
  <dt><a name="pristine" id="pristine">Pristine copy </a></dt>
  <dd>SVN stores a pristine copy of the base revision (i.e., the unmodified checked-out
    revision) of each file in the working copy. These pristine copies are known
    as &quot;text bases&quot; and are used for performing offline diffs, and
    for transmitting deltas back to the server when committing.</dd>
  <dt><a name="repository"></a>Repository</dt>
  <dd>
    In this context, the SVN version-controlled container for all of your project
        resources.
  </dd>
  <dt><a name="commandline"></a>'svn' command line</dt>
  <dd>
    The "reference" implementation of the SVN client is the command line
  </dd>
  <dt><a name="tag">Tag</a></dt>
  <dd>
    A tag is a snapshot of an application codeline at a specific point in time
        and are typically used to label a specific revision of the repository
        code.
  </dd>
  <dt><a name="trunk"></a>Trunk</dt>
  <dd>
    The <em>trunk</em> of a development is the project folder where the mainline
    development takes place. It is a naming convention only; no feature or function
    is implicit in this term.
  </dd>
  <dt><a name="Unified" id="Unified">Unified Diff </a></dt>
  <dd>A standard representation for the differences between two files where removed
    lines are prefaced with a <span class="code">-</span> and added lines are
    prefaced with a <span class="code">+</span>.</dd>
  <dt><a name="working">Working copy</a></dt>
  <dd>A local, version controlled copy of a repository's files and directories.</dd>
