  <p>This file selector is used to discriminate files within a fileset based on a Subversion 
  status. In particular, this selector keeps files that are recognized as 'normal'.</p>

  <p>A 'normal' file or directory is one that has not undergone any changes since the last 
  update. In general, this is the great majority of the files in a working copy. <b>svn status</b> 
  returns no special character for those items (a space in the first column).</p>

  <p>Example:</p>
  <p>to copy a number of files with the status 'normal' from their location in <b>workingcopy</b> 
  to a new directory called <b>test</b>, the following ant task can be used:</p>

  <snippet type="xml">
    &lt;copy todir="test"&gt;
        &lt;fileset dir="workingcopy"&gt;
            &lt;svnNormal/&gt;
        &lt;/fileset&gt;
    &lt;/copy&gt;
  </snippet>
