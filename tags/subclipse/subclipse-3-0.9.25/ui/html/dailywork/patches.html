	<h1>Creating and applying patches</h1>
	
	Often, when work on a project is shared between many developers, you need to work with,
	review and mabye transfer changes that haven't been committed yet. For this, Subclipse
	offers the functionality to <a href="../reference/create-patch.html">create a patch</a>,
	which works with Eclipse's build-in <a href="/../reference/apply-patch.html">apply patch</a>.
	<p>Patches are representations of changes to a given version of the repository state, and
	can easily be transferred to other developers, for instance in one developer (who doesn't have
	commit access) needs to submit a change to someone who can then review and commit it.
