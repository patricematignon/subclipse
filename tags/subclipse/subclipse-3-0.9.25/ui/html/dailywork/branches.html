	<h1>Maintaining branches with Subclipse</h1>
	
	<p>Like many other SCM systems, Subversion has the notion of working with separate
	branches of the same project, meaning that different lines of development are isolated
	in different parts of the repository, but that it is possible to work with sets of changes,
	including comparing whole branches and copying changes between branches.
	<p>Typically, the 'main' line of development in a project using the Subversion SCM system is
	called the <em>trunk</em>, but this is not a technical requirement, it is a convention.
	<p>In Subversion, tagging and branching is a quite efficient mechanism, which may help you in
	your day-to-day work.
	
	<h2>Tagging</h2>
	<p>Assuming that most of the work in a project is done in the 'trunk' of the repository,
	you may want to "save the state" of the repository, for instance whenever you release a version
	of the ensuing product or otherwise reach a milestone. Obviously, you could just write down which
	revision number was the current one and then you could always use that information to restore
	the contents of the project, use it for comparison, etc. However, you can also give the tag an
	explicit name so that it is easier to refer to.
	
	<p>To compare: In the Subversion command line, this is done simply by copying the repository location
	(like <tt>http://svn-server/bigproj/trunk/</tt>) on to a new, different location which could
		(like <tt>http://svn-server/bigproj/tags/client-release-0.99/</tt>) using <tt>svn cp</tt>.
	<p>By convention, you never commit anything to a tag repository locations, they merely exist pinpoint
	a specific repository content. There is nothing which stops you from doing this (although Subclipse
	will warn you), it's just a convention. If you need to make a copy and work in a different direction,
	use a branch.
			 
	<h2>Branching</h2>
	<p>TODO - How to make a branch. Hint: it's the same as making a tag.

	<h2>Merging changes</h2>
	<p>TODO - How to copy the changes from one or more revisions from the trunk to a branch.

	<h2>Backporting</h2>
	<p>TODO - How to copy the changes from a branch back to the main trunk (hint: It's the same as above)
