<h1>Team > Share</h1>

<p>Sharing a project in a Subversion repository works by connecting to an existing repository
(by using a new or existing location from the <a href="svn-repository-view.html">SVN Repository View</a>).
The project is then imported into the repository at that location.
<p>Note: If the project was already a Subversion working copy then the repository information is
read, then no further action need happen - the Share operation marks the project as under version control.
