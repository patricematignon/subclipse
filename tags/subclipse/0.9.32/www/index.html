<p>There are three projects hosted on this site:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b><a href="#subclipse">Subclipse</a></b> is an <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> plugin that adds <a href=

<h2><a name="subclipse">Current Release</a></h2>
  
  <p>Be sure to check the <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectNewsList">announcements</a> for information on the latest release.
  We also maintain a <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/subclipse/changes.html">Subclipse changelog</a> that contains information about all changes, including those that have not been released yet.
  Finally, you can also subscribe to the announcements <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">mailing list</a> to be notified of new releases.</p>

  <p><b>NOTE:</b> Subclipse requires that you have the Subversion JavaHL library installed for it to
work properly.  For Windows users, we are able to provide a working version of JavaHL as part of Subclipse.
For other platforms, you have to provide the JavaHL library yourself.  There is more information about this further down on the page. Be sure you read
it.  There is also a 100% Java alternative to JavaHL named JavaSVN that is in development.  Information
about JavaSVN is also included below and you can try that option if you cannot obtain the JavaHL libraries
for your environment.</p>

  <h4>Eclipse 2.1.3</h4>

  <p>Subclipse 0.9.3.3 is linked against Subversion 1.1.4.  Binaries for Windows are included.</p>
  <p>Development for this version of Eclipse is no longer active.  There are no new releases planned.</p>

  <p><a href=
  "http://subclipse.tigris.org/files/documents/906/22688/org.tigris.subversion.subclipse_0.9.3.3.zip"
  target="new">Download</a></p>

  <h4>Eclipse 3.0/3.1</h4>

  <p>Subclipse releases for Eclipse 3.x are hosted at
      our update site. Add <a href=
  "http://subclipse.tigris.org/update">http://subclipse.tigris.org/update</a>
  as an update site in Eclipse's update manager (which you can find
  in the Help menu).</p>

  <p>The update site itself can be <a
  href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=2240">downloaded</a>
  and used as a local update site as well. Simply unzip the site archive,
  and add the path as a new "Local Site" in the Eclipse
  update manager.  You can also host your own internal Subclipse update
  site by placing the site on your own HTTP server (be sure to update
  site.xml appropriately).

  <h4>Using Subclipse with JavaSVN</h4>
  <p>You may make Subclipse use a pure Java svn client library instead of the JavaHL bindings. After
     installing Subclipse, install "JavaSVN Subclipse Extension" feature using <b>http://tmate.org/svn/</b>
     update site location. You may find more details on JavaSVN at <a href="http://tmate.org/svn/">http://tmate.org/svn/</a>
     web site.
  </p>
  <p><b>NOTE:</b> JavaSVN supports <b>svn</b>, <b>svn+ssh</b> and <b>http</b>
  connection protocols. <b>file</b> protocol is not supported and <b>https</b> protocol may not work with some servers depending
  on the JDK version you're using and server SSL certificate. JavaSVN will work with Eclipse 3.0 or newer only.

  <h2><a name="faq">FAQ</a></h2>

  <p><strong>What version of Eclipse does Subclipse support
  ?</strong></p>

  <p>The current versions of Subclipse supports both Eclipse 2.1.x
      and Eclipse 3.0 Line</p>

  <p><strong>Why is Subclipse so particular about what version of
  Subclipse and Berkeley DB is used?</strong></p>

  <p>Subclipse uses a JNI interface ( <a href=
  "http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/subversion/bindings/java/javahl/">
  javahl</a>) to Subversion. The binaries that come with Subclipse
  are linked with particular versions when compiled. We have also
  been developing a way to interface with the command line client
  (Windows-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Team-&gt;SVN)</p>

  <p>Keep in mind, you'll have best results with a libsvnjavahl
      built with your own system.</p>

  <p><strong>So if Subclipse is tied to a Subversion version, will
  it be updated when a new version of Subversion comes
  out?</strong></p>

  <p>Yes, we will try to update Subclipse when a new version of
      Subversion comes out</p>

  <p><strong>Why does Subclipse only support Windows?</strong></p>

  <p>Subclipse runs on any platform that Eclipse runs on.  The issue is that
for technical reasons we are only able to reliably deliver the Subversion binaries
for the Windows platform.  As long as you have a working JavaHL library on your platform
Subclipse should work.  If you have difficulty, you can also try JavaSVN a 100% pure Java
alternative to JavaHL.</p>

  <p><strong>Will the plugin work with WSAD?</strong></p>

  <p>Only WSAD 5.1 and above as this is based on Eclipse 2.1.3 which is a minimum requirement for Subclipse</p>

  <p>Subclipse works great with the new Rational 6.0 versions.</p>


  <p><strong>Do I need Subversion installed to use
  Subclipse?</strong></p>

  <p>Not if you use Windows. If you don't use Windows, you
      <em>do</em> need Subversion and its dependencies installed.
      Currently, the JNI bits (libsvnjavahl) link dynamically to the
      Subversion sources, so you may have problems if your installation
      of Subversion is out of date, or compiled agains something other
      than what we compiled against. As mentioned above, if you are
      having problems with Subclipse, we recommend rolling your own
      libsvnjavahl. This is particularly true on OSX, if your Subversion
      isn't built with fink.</p>

  <p>To do this, just</p>
  <pre>
      make javahl &amp;&amp; make install-javahl
</pre>

  <p><strong>What access methods does Subclipse
  support?</strong></p>

  <p>Since Subclipse just calls out to Subversion, Subclipse can
      use any access method your command-line Subversion client can
      understand.</p>

  <p><strong>How do I get Subversion to accept my self-signed
  certificate?</strong></p>
  </p>

  <p>If you are using JavaHL and the Subclipse 0.9.28 or later you should just be prompted to
accept it.  Otherwise, you can just run the command line command:</p>
  <pre>
      svn list https://your/repo
</pre>
  <p>and opt to accept the certificate permanently. From then on,
      subclipse will also accept the certificate.</p>
  <p><strong>Why did you stop shipping the native javahl with Subclipse?
  </strong></p>
  <p>We could never figure out how to link them statically, and sending out
      dynamically linked libraries made my personal build system's configuration
      a build dependency (that is, if you didn't have a nearly identical setup to
      me personally, you'd wind up with mysterious failures when trying to use 
      Subclipse).
<p>Hopefully this won't be too much of a burden. For OSX users, the 
          <a href="http://metissian.com/projects/macosx/subversion/">Metissian</a> packages are 
          excellently done, and hopefully Linux SVN package maintainers will start
          shipping javahl (after y'all bug them to death about it ;) )
<p>If your package maintainer doesn't ship javahl, PLEASE send them a polite email
         asking them to consider including it.  
<p>If worse comes to worse (and this isn't too bad), you can build javahl yourself. Consult
        the SVN install documentation for more info. The short course goes like this:
<pre>./configure --your-other-flags=here --enable-javahl
             --with-jdk=$JAVA_HOME --with-jikes=$JAVA_HOME/bin/javac
             &amp;&amp;make &amp;&amp; install install-javahl
        </pre>
