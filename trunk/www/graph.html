<h1 style="text-align: center;">Subversion Revision Graph</h1>
<p>The Subclipse project participated in the 2008 Google <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/">Summer of Code</a> program.  One of
the projects we mentored was to add a revision graph feature to the Subclipse plug-in.  The
student who signed on for this task was <a href="http://gimenetegsoc.wordpress.com/">Alberto Gimeno</a>.  Alberto did a fantastic job on this
feature and we are pleased to have integrated his work, and this feature, into Subclipse.
This document will provide some information on the feature, how to install and how to use it.</p>

<div class="h2" id="install" title="install">
<h2>Install the Revision Graph feature</h2>

<p>We may revisit this decision in the future, but for now the revision graph feature
is a separate Eclipse feature from the rest of Subclipse.  This is because the revision
graph feature requires additional dependencies (GEF/Draw2D) than core Subclipse and
we did not want require that all Subclipse users must have those dependencies.  The feature
itself is on the main Subclipse update site, so to install it just follow the normal procedure
for installing Subclipse and be sure to select the Revision graph feature on the install screen.</p>

<h2>Overview of the Revision Graph feature</h2>

<p>If you are just looking for a quick-start, then right-click on a file either in your local
workspace or the SVN Repository view and look for the "View file history as graph" option.  This
will open the revision graph for the selected item.  The option is enabled for files and folders
but really only works well for files.  Depending on the size of your repository and whether
the local cache has already been built, you should see something like the following:</p>

<h3>History Cache</h3>

<p>The Subversion repository format is not naturally conducive to supporting a revision
graph because it does not store or record copy-to information in the repository.  Consequently,
the only way to get this information is to retrieve the history of the entire repository and
calculate that information in the graph itself.  For obvious reasons, this does not perform
well.  To make performance generally acceptable we maintain a local cache of revision history
and update it when necessary.  Of course this means the first time you use the option you will
take a performance hit while the cache is initially loaded.  Subsequent actions should be relatively
quick and the cache will update with new revisions as needed.</p>

<p>The cache is associated with a repository, so if you have multiple projects from the same
repository, you do not need to maintain a separate cache for each project.  We have added options
in the SVN Repository view to clear/build the cache for a repository.  Those were mainly added to
make it easier for us to maintain the cache during development.  They are not really needed in
normal usage but could become necessary if we run into bugs in maintaining the cache information.</p>

<p>A lot of effort went into making the cache as performant as possible.  
We currently use a custom binary format that is yielding pretty good performance.  When used on the
nearly 40k revision Subversion repository, as an example, the cache builds in around a minute.  You
still might not want to use the feature on really large repositories, such as the Apache.org
repository.</p>

<h3>Visualization</h3>

<p>A major problem we have seen with other attempts at a Subversion revision graph is that
they are typically too big, with too much information, to be useful.  We cannot claim to have
solved that problem but we have made attempts to "reduce the noise".  For example, for any
location where an item has been copied but not modified, we treat it as a "tag" and rather than
showing it on the graph, we instead annotate the revision that was copied with the tag locations.
Another area where we help reduce noise is deleted branches.  For this scenario, we give you
three options.  You can simply hide these, show these or hide them only if the file was never
modified on the branch.</p>

<p>The revision graph was built using the Eclipse Draw2D/GEF plugins.  It includes a number
of features that are common in plugins built on top of GEF.  You can zoom in/out, export to
a graphic, and also navigate a large diagram using the Outline view.</p>

<img src="/images/graph/outline.png" alt="Graph with outline view" />

<p>There are certainly
improvements that could be made in the visualization.  We went with the current approach as
it produced a compact, but generally useful visualization.  We would welcome any experts
in graphics or GEF in particular to help make it better.</p>

<h3>Support for Merge Information</h3>

<p>We wanted to include support for showing merges on the revision graph.  With Subversion
1.5 and the introduction of merge tracking, this is something that should now be possible.
What we discovered in testing and development was that the way the Subversion API currently works
it is not conducive to retrieving the merge information for an entire repository.  It just killed
the performance.  So what we did to offset this was the following.  When you the cache is built, it
does not gather any merge information, and when you bring up a graph you will not see any merge
information.  However, for any given revision in the graph, you can select it and take the
"Refresh revision" option.  That will go out and get the merge information for that revision,
store it in the cache, and re-draw the graph.  Using the toolbar, you can refresh all of the
revisions on the graph at once, although performance for that option is not always great either.
This approach has allowed us to make the graph support the display of merge information and will
make it easier for us to improve this in the future as the Subversion API is refined to allow
this information to be retrieved in a way that is more performant.</p>

<p>Here is a simple example where the graph has been refreshed to show the merges:</p>
