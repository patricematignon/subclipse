<p>There are three projects hosted on this site:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b><a href="#subclipse">Subclipse</a></b> is an <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> plugin that adds <a href=
"http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> integration to the Eclipse IDE.  Subclipse is licensed
        under the terms of the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl-v10.html">Common Public License (CPL) 1.0.</a></li>
  <li><b><a href="svnClientAdapter.html">svnClientAdapter</a></b> is a high-level Java API for Subversion and is used by Subclipse.
        svnClientAdapter is licensed under the terms of the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache Software License 2.0</a></li>
  <li><b><a href="svnant.html">svnAnt</a></b> is an <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> task that uses svnClientAdapter and provides access to Subversion from Ant scripts.

</ul>
<h2><a name="subclipse">Current Release</a></h2>
  <p><br /><b>Subclipse 1.0.2 is now available!</b></p>
  <p>See the <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/subclipse/changes.html#1.0.2">changelog</a>
  for details.  Existing Subclipse users should read the <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/servlets/NewsItemView?newsItemID=1514">
  1.0.0 release announcement</a> for details on how to
  upgrade to the 1.0.x release.</p>
  <p>Be sure to check the <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectNewsList">announcements</a> for information on the latest release.
  We also maintain a <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/subclipse/changes.html">Subclipse changelog</a> that contains information about all changes, including those that have not been released yet.
  Finally, you can also subscribe to the announcements <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">mailing list</a> to be notified of new releases.</p>

  <p><b>NOTE:</b> Subclipse requires a Subversion client "adapter" to communicate with your repository.  Subclipse includes a 100% pure Java
  client adapter named JavaSVN.  Information about JavaSVN can be found at <a href="http://tmate.org/svn/">http://tmate.org/svn/</a>. For
  Windows users, Subclipse also includes the Subversion JavaHL library which communicates with your repository using the standard Subversion
  libraries and API.  For other platforms, you have to provide the JavaHL library yourself.  There is more information about building or
  obtaining JavaHL in the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>.<br><br>
  The JavaSVN client adapter should work for most users, the notable exception being users that absolutely have to have support for the
  file:// protocol, which JavaSVN does not currently support.  JavaSVN offers a few additional features to Subclipse users that JavaHL does
  not offer, and it probably performs slightly faster than JavaHL.  That being said, JavaHL uses the standard Subversion libraries which insures
  it will be compatible with other Subversion clients.</p>

  <h4>Eclipse 3.x</h4>

  <p>Subclipse releases for Eclipse 3.x are hosted at
      our update site. Add <a href=
  "http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.0.x">http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.0.x</a>
  as an update site in Eclipse's update manager (which you can find
  in the Help menu).</p>

  <p>The update site itself can be <a
  href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=2240">downloaded</a>
  and used as a local update site as well. Simply unzip the site archive,
  and add the path as a new "Local Site" in the Eclipse
  update manager.  You can also host your own internal Subclipse update
  site by placing the site on your own HTTP server (be sure to update
  site.xml appropriately).</p>
  
  <p>We also provide <a href="install.html">instructions for installing Subclipse in Eclipse 3.x</a></p>

  <h4>Eclipse 2.1.3</h4>

  <p>Subclipse 0.9.3.3 is linked against Subversion 1.1.4.  Binaries for Windows are included.</p>
  <p>Development for this version of Eclipse is no longer active.  There are no new releases planned.</p>

  <p><a href=
  "http://subclipse.tigris.org/files/documents/906/22688/org.tigris.subversion.subclipse_0.9.3.3.zip"
  target="new">Download the Eclipse 2.x version</a></p>
