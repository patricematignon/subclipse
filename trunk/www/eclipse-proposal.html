<h1 style="text-align: center;">Status of Eclipse SVN Proposal</h1>

<p>The members of the team that proposed the SVN project at Eclipse.org
   have decided to withdraw the proposal. There are a lot of factors that
   have gone into this decision, so any answer or explanation will be
   incomplete, but it is necessary to state some of the reasons we have
   come to this decision.</p>

<p>For most of the team members, our motivation in making this proposal
   was to eventually make great Subversion support a part of the Eclipse
   platform and also to work with the existing developers of the Team API
   to make it better and offer more common functionality to team
   providers. While we would not go so far as to say we were told neither
   of these things were ever going to happen, it would be fair to say
   that is the current feeling of most of our members. In other words,
   Subversion support does not appear likely to ever become part of the
   Eclipse Platform SDK component; it will always be a separate download
   like Mylar or CDT. Certainly it would become part of some future
   release train, like Europa, but it seems unlikely it would ever be
   more than that. Likewise, we did not sense a great deal of interest
   in enhancing the Team component to provide more functionality than
   exists today. Again, let me be clear, these are just our perceptions.
   We might be wrong, and they are certainly not aimed at any specific
   individual working on Eclipse.</p>

<p>It would be less than honest to not also mention the Subversive
   proposal. We do not have any problems with their proposal or their
   team. The fact that they exist, and that continuing with our proposal
   would also mean having to contend with those issues, was just another
   factor in not wanting to pursue our proposal. It was clear to our
   team that the only way we could work together would be for one of our
   teams to drop our existing code and join the other. We are not prepared
   to do that and neither are they.</p>

<p>One final factor in this decision was licensing. Any Subversion plug-in
   is going to depend on either Subversion's JavaHL library or the SVNKit
   pure Java library. SVNKit's license was rejected by Eclipse, and in the
   case of Subversion they were planning to review all the code before
   allowing us to use the library. Subversion has dependencies on libraries
   like Neon and BDB that have licenses that are not typically accepted by
   Eclipse. So we had some question as to whether we would be able to
   include JavaHL or SVNKit with our plug-in. Again, maybe this will turn
   out to not be an issue for Subversive. Also, we are not faulting the
   Eclipse IP code review process wither. That review is one of the best
   features of being part of Eclipse.org.</p> 

<p>In the end, the only benefits we saw were being able to be listed on the
   release train update site, and possibly getting some new participants in
   the project. Those are real benefits without question, but they have to
   be balanced against the negatives, of which we thought there were many. So
   we have decided that we will stick with Subclipse and leave the project
   right here on tigris.org.</p>

<p>Moving forward we have a lot planned for Subclipse this year. We are
   working more closely than ever with the Subversion development community
   and we have a number of great enhancements coming to Subversion and JavaHL
   in the Subversion 1.5 release. We will be updating the roadmap page in
   the near future with some of our plans, but it should be an exciting
   year for Subclipse.</p>
