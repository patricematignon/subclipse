			<p><i>A start has been made with the update action that uses the TeamOperation API. It locks the project that is being updated and
                 allows the user to work on other projects. All lengthy subclipse actions should be backgroundable.

				 <li>add an external by browsing the repository and then do an svn update to  get it checked out</li>
				 <li>see externals in the repository browser (as links, or something)</li>
