<p>This page contains information on past, current and future Subclipse releases
  as well as the process we follow to produce our releases.</p>

<div class="h2" id="release-process" title="release-process">
<h2>How We Manage Releases</h2>
<p>
Subclipse follows an odd/even release strategy.  So as an example,
the 1.1.x and 1.3.x releases are "developer" releases for people that want to
test the latest features.  These culminate in 1.2.x and 1.4.x releases that
will be the official "stable" releases.  We do this so that we can use the Eclipse
update site mechanism to easily deliver our developer releases to the users
that want to use them. Historically the developer releases have been very
stable and when problems do arise they are fixed quickly.

<table border="1" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
    <tr><th>Release</th><th>Date</th><th>Eclipse Version</th><th>Subversion Version</th><th>Details</th></tr>

<p>
The above table shows the initial release date for each Subclipse stable release as
well as the minimum Eclipse version supported and the version of Subversion
that is required and currently included in the latest version in that release line.
The Eclipse version will never change once a release is issued (1.0.x releases
will always support Eclipse 3.0). As new versions of Subversion are released we
typically issue new point releases that include support for that version of
Subversion (Subclipse 1.0.0 included Subversion 1.3.x but Subclipse 1.0.4 added
support for Subversion 1.4.x). Once we move to a new version of Subversion we
can no longer support the older versions.

<h2>Upcoming Releases</h2>
<p>
Here is some information on future releases.
</p>
<div class="h3" id="next-release" title="next-release">
<h3>Next Release: 1.6.0</h3>
<p>
We are currently continuing to refine the existing 1.4.x release and are adding new
features to it.  As Subversion approaches its 1.6 release milestone we will examine
if we need to start a 1.6.0 release process or can add support for Subversion 1.6
in the existing 1.4.x release.</p>
<p>
Use the following issue tracker query to get an idea what is in the 1.4.0
release.</p>

<div class="h3" id="beyond-release" title="beyond-release">
<h3>Beyond the Next Release</h3>
<p>
Subclipse is a mature and stable product that supports all Subversion features. 
Future releases will focus on improving usability. We are most actively working
on adding a revisio graph feature.  We sponsored work on this feature as part of
Google Summer of Code 2008 and are currently focusing on getting the feature
into the official release.
