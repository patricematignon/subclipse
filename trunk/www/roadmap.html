<h3>Roadmap</h3>

<p>
Subclipse 1.0 Release Candidate 1 was released on January 10, 2006.  The final
1.0 release should be available in 3 to 4 weeks depending on the types of issues
that come in from the RC1.
</p>

<p>
The 1.0.x version of Subclipse is now maintained in a branch in the repository.  The
1.0.x release will receive major bug fixes and possibly some minor feature updates.  It
is likely that future versions of Subclipse will require Eclipse 3.1 or higher.  More
information will come about in the future.
