<p>This page contains information on past, current and future Subclipse releases
  as well as the process we follow to produce our releases.</p>

<div class="h2" id="release-process" title="release-process">
<h2>How We Manage Releases</h2>
<p>
Subclipse follows an odd/even release strategy.  So as an example,
the 1.1.x and 1.3.x releases are "developer" releases for people that want to
test the latest features.  These culminate in 1.2.x and 1.4.x releases that
will be the official "stable" releases.  We do this so that we can use the Eclipse
update site mechanism to easily deliver our developer releases to the users
that want to use them. Historically the developer releases have been very
stable and when problems do arise they are fixed quickly.

<h2>Current Releases</h2>
<br />
<table border="1" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
    <tr><th>Release</th><th>Date</th><th>Eclipse Version</th><th>Subversion Version</th><th>Details</th></tr>
    <tr><td>1.0.0</td><td>2006-04-11</td><td>3.0 - 3.1</td><td>1.4.x</td><td><a href="subclipse/changes.html">changelog</a></td></tr>

<p>
The above table shows the initial release date for each Subclipse stable release as
well as the minimum Eclipse version supported and the version of Subversion
that is required and currently included in the latest version in that release line.
The Eclipse version will never change once a release is issued (1.0.x releases
will always support Eclipse 3.0). As new versions of Subversion are released we
typically issue new point releases that include support for that version of
Subversion (Subclipse 1.0.0 included Subversion 1.3.x but Subclipse 1.0.4 added
support for Subversion 1.4.x). Once we move to a new version of Subversion we
can no longer support the older versions.

<h2>Upcoming Releases</h2>
<p>
Here is some information on future releases.
</p>
<div class="h3" id="next-release" title="next-release">
<h3>Next Release: 1.4.0</h3>
<p>
Development is underway on the 1.4.0 release.  This release will be focused on
Subversion 1.5 support and will be released soon after the Subversion 1.5.0 GA
which should happen in mid-late summer 2007. Subversion 1.5 contains a number of
new and exciting features including a number of enhancements that were specifically
targeted at improving Subclipse and other IDE integrations. We will get a release
out quickly that leverages many of these features and then continue to issue point
releases throughout the year that adds additional support for these new features.
</p>
<p>
Use the following issue tracker query to get an idea what will be in the 1.4.0
release.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/issues/buglist.cgi?component=subclipse&amp;target_milestone=1.4">
All Issues for 1.4 Release</a>
</p>
<p>Obviously items that are completed will be included in the release, open
items are tentatively planned for the release but may not be included depending on
the timeline of when Subversion 1.5.0 release. Subclipse 1.4.0 release date will be
driven by the Subversion release date.</p>

<div class="h3" id="beyond-release" title="beyond-release">
<h3>Beyond the Next Release</h3>
<p>
Subclipse is a mature and stable product that supports all Subversion features. 
Future releases will focus on improving usability. For example making sure that
dialogs can be controlled via keyboard only, general look and feel issue of dialogs
etc. Of course there are always new Subversion features to add support for and we
will always give those high priority.
</p>
<p>
Another goal in the upcoming releases will be better support for multi-project
operations. This could be classified as a usability improvement, but it is such
an important usability issue it deserves to be called out and brought into focus.
Operations like branch/tag, merge and switch need to be enhanced so that they can
be performed on multiple projects at the same time.
