<h1 style="text-align: center;">Downloads and Installation Instructions</h1>

<p>See the <a href="subclipse/changes.html">changelog</a> for the latest version of Subclipse.
Unless otherwise noted, the best available version is always the most recently released version.</p>

<p>Detailed installation instructions for Subclipse in Eclipse 3.x
can be found on the page <a href="install.html">Installation Instructions</a>.
Generally speaking, Subclipse is installed and updated from
within Eclipse.  There is no specific external download needed.</p>

<p>For all svnAnt, svnClientAdapter and Eclipse 2.x, downloads can be found here:

<p>The Eclipse 2.x development line is no longer active.  We are no longer
fixing bugs in Eclipse 2.x nor making Eclipse 2.x releases.  Only the discovery of
a horrible data-loss or security bug would prompt us to do another
Eclipse 2.x release.  If you discover a bug in Eclipse 2.x, it is likely already
fixed in a later development line.  If you report the bug, you'll
probably be told to upgrade first.  Likewise, the same can all be said for
Subversion 1.1.x and earlier.  The last release of Subclipse that supported
Subversion 1.1.x was the 0.9.30 release.  Due to changes in the JavaHL and command-line
interface in Subversion 1.2 it was not practical to continue to support both releases.</p>
