<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />The recommended process for install Subclipse is to use the Eclipse Marketplace Client.  The latest version of Subclipse is always available and it is the easiest way to install Subclipse.  If you do not have the Eclipse Marketplace Client, you can install Subclipse via the normal Eclipse plugin install process.  Typically this is done via Help > Install/Update.  Enter the URL for the Subclipse update site or download the zipped update site and choose Local Archived Site from the Eclipse install GUI.
