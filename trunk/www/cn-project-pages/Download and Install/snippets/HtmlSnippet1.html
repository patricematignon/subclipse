<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><p>                              The recommended process to install Subclipse is to use the <a href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/marketplace-client-intro">Eclipse Marketplace Client</a> .  The latest version of Subclipse is always available via the Marketplace and it is the easiest way to install Subclipse.  If you do not have the Eclipse Marketplace Client, you can install Subclipse via the normal Eclipse plugin install process.  Typically this is done via an option on the Eclipse Help menu.  Enter the URL for the Subclipse update site into the Eclipse install GUI or download the zipped update site and choose Local Archived Site from the Eclipse install GUI.&nbsp; Here is a useful article with tips on installing Eclipse plugins:</p><p><a href="http://blog.zvikico.com/2009/07/ten-tips-for-installing-plugins-in-eclipse-galileo.html">http://blog.zvikico.com/2009/07/ten-tips-for-installing-plugins-in-eclipse-galileo.html </a> </p><p>When installing recent versions of Subclipse, the following features must be installed:</p><ul><li>Subclipse - this is the main feature that include the Subclipse core and UI plugins</li><li>svnClientAdapter - this is the Subversion API wrapper that Subclipse uses to talk to Subversion</li></ul><p>One or both of the following svnClientAdapter API providers must also be installed:</p><ul><li>JavaHL - this is recommended as it is the API provided as part of Subversion itself.&nbsp; See this <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/wiki/JavaHL">wiki page</a>  for more information.</li><li>SVNKit - this is a pure Java implementation of the Subversion API provided and supported by a <a target="_blank" href="http://svnkit.com">3rd party</a>.</li></ul><p>The following optional features are also provided on the update site.&nbsp; These features are not required for Subclipse to work.&nbsp; If you are having problems installing them, because you are missing plugins that these require, then simply deselect them in the UI and do not install them.</p><ul><li>Revision graph - provides a graphical view of SVN history.&nbsp; Requires the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eclipse.org/gef">Eclipse GEF/Draw2D plugin</a>.</li><li>Mylyn integration - provides some additional integration between Subclipse and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn">Mylyn</a> .&nbsp; If you are not using Mylyn, then you do not need this. <br /></li></ul>
