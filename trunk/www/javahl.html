<h3>JavaHL API Wishlist</h3>

<p>
The purpose of this page is to document enhancements to the JavaHL API that
we could use in Subclipse.  When a Subversion developer has time to work on
JavaHL they can use this as a bit of a to-do list.</p>

<div class="table">
<table>
<thead>
	<tr>
		<th>Item</th>
		<th>Developer(s)</th>
		<th>Status</th>
		<th>Version</th>
	</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>Commit Across Working Copies.  In the Eclipse environment the typical
		setup is that you have an Eclipse workspace which is just a folder somewhere
		and NOT a Subversion working copy.  You then do checkouts within Eclipse of
		various projects and this creates a bunch of isolated working copies within
		that workspace folder.  The problem is that JavaHL does not allow you to perform
		a single atomic commit of files from multiple projects, because the working
		copies are joined.  JavaSVN added a very nice new API that solves this problem.  We
		just give JavaSVN everything to commit, and it figures out if the files are in
		the same repository and if so, commits them in a single commit.  If not, it groups
		the commits by repository.  This is a really great feature.</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>needed</td>
		<td>N/A</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Peg revision support in svn log command.  We are adding support for
		"paging" in our history view.  This can break when looking at the history
		of a branch and you request a "page" of revisions from before the branch
		creation.  With peg revision support this would work better.</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>needed</td>
		<td>N/A</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Network statistics.  Subversion 1.3 included new API support for
		reporting network statistics when using HTTP.  We could potentially
		provide better progress information if we had this.  Ideally, all ra_ 
		methods would support it though.</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>needed</td>
		<td>N/A</td>
