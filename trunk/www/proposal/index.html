<h1>SVN Team Provider Project</h1>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> This proposal is currently only a draft version.  We are
developing this proposal following the same process that we use to develop
Subclipse.  Discussion is taking place on the <a 
href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/servlets/SummarizeList?listName=dev">dev@
mailing list</a> and the files are stored in our <a 
href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/source/browse/subclipse/trunk/www/proposal/">
Subversion repository.</a></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The SVN Team Provider Project is a proposed open source project 
under the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/technology/">Eclipse Technology
Project</a>.</p>

<p>This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/"> Eclipse Development
Process document</a>) and is written to declare its intent and scope. This 
proposal is written to solicit additional participation and  input from the 
Eclipse community. You are invited to comment on and/or join the project. Please 
send all feedback to the <a 
href="news://news.eclipse.org/eclipse.technology.svn">
news://news.eclipse.org/eclipse.technology.svn</a> newsgroup.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Subversion (SVN) is very popular and will soon overtake CVS as the most 
widely used open source version control system. Many hosting services are 
providing SVN access, and several major open source projects have converted
their CVS repositories to SVN. Eclipse has great support for CVS, and users
are looking for similar support for SVN.  Eclipse has no support for SVN out
of the box, which compares poorly to competitorrs such as Netbeans and IDEA.
Many new users will not know that they can download a 3rd party plugin to add
SVN support.</p>
<p>In addition to adding SVN support to Eclipse, there is the issue of providing
a solid Team API that can be leveraged by commercial and open source SCM
providers.  The current Team API is very capable, but at the same time it is 
also hindered by having only one concrete implementation.  In many instances
the API has become very CVS centric.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the issue of providing support for SVN to projects hosted
by Eclipse.org.  The code for this project should be hosted in an SVN repository
and it is likely that there are other projects currently hosted at Eclipse.org 
that would like to migrate their repositories from CVS to SVN.  Part of this 
proposal is to provide resources and expertise that will support the Eclipse 
Foundation in their efforts to provide these services to the community.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>The objectives of the SVN Team Provider project are to: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Provide support for accessing and manipulating projects that are hosted
	in a Subversion repository.</li>
	<li>Provide UI and features that are familiar to existing Eclipse CVS users,
	while at the same time providing appropriate UI and access to SVN-specific 
	features.</li>
	<li>Provide a simple API for accessing Subversion functions, as well as
	support headless operations of Team provider functions.  These items will
	make it easier for other plug-ins to add Subversion functionality as 
	needed.</li>
	<li>Provide accurate and up to date documentation on using the features of
	the SVN provider.</li>
	<li>Support, implement and follow the latest best practices for Eclipse UI
	development	as appropriate for the current Eclipse release.</li>
    <li>Contribute to the development and refinement of the Eclipse Core Team
    API.</li>
	<li>Assist resources at the Eclipse Foundation in offering SVN hosting to
	projects.</li>
	<li>Assist the release engineering team to add SVN support to their tools
	and process.</li>
</ul>
	
<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The initial code for this project will be based on a code contribution from
the <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/">Subclipse</a> project.  
Subclipse provides a robust and stable implementation of Subversion 
functionality as an Eclipse Team Provider.  The Subclipse code 
and architecture is based on the Eclipse CVS provider, so it should be easy
for the existing Team and CVS developers to understand, should they decide to
contribute.</p>

<p>The foundation for this project is a common Subversion API layer called the
SVN Client Adapter (<b>org.eclipse.subversion.client</b>).  This adapter gives
clients full access to any SVN repository (even those not under direct control
of the SVN Team Provider).  The adapter serves to create an abstraction on top
of all client adapter implementations (JavaHL, JavaSVN and the SVN command line
client).  This adapter defines a standard Eclipse extension point, that 
provider implementations can contribute to in order to provide an 
implementation.  The user can then select which provider implementation they
wish to use in their client preferences.</p>

<p>The default SVN Client Adapter will be JavaHL, which is the official Java
language bindings for the Subversion native libraries.  JavaHL is developed,
maintained and provided as part of the Subversion project and is licensed under
the <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_license.html">Subversion
license.</a></p>

<p>One of the main problems with CVS that Subversion sought to address was
the lack of an official API.  Subversion was designed as a set of layered
libraries with well-defined interfaces, designed to be called by
other applications.  These libraries are delivered as native C libraries in
order to achieve the maximum portability across both operating systems and
programming languages, as most languages have a facility for accessing C
libraries.  JavaHL is the name for the Java language bindings to these
libraries.  JavaHL is similar to SWT.  It accesses the libraries via JNI while
providing a standardized interface to Java clients.  Since virtually all SVN
clients use these same libraries, there is great compatability when using
multiple clients on the same local working copy.  The Subversion API also
has very strictly defined compatability rules and the Subversion client and
server are both forward and backwards compatible with each other.</p>

<p>The Subclipse project has figured out how to deliver the native
libraries for JavaHL for the Windows platform only.  Currently, an Eclipse user
running on Linux has to install Subversion using the packaging system for their
distribution.  This then installs all of the required native libraries, 
including the JavaHL library.  There are similar facilities available for OS X
users.  We would be interested in working with the Eclipse platform project to
see if there are changes that could be made to Eclipse to enable native 
libraries to be delivered by a plug-in fragment when those libraries have 
dependencies on other libraries.  In the short term, users on non-Windows
platforms would have to obtain the JavaHL native library for their operating
system.  All of the major Linux distributions now make this very easy to do
and really is not much different than how a Linux user that uses KDE has to
make sure they have the GTK2 libraries installed before they can use SWT and
Eclipse.</p>

<p>There is also a third party library named JavaSVN that has been developed
by a company called TMate.  <a href="http://tmate.org/svn/">
http://tmate.org/svn/</a>.  They have reverse-engineered the Subversion network
protocols and working copy format and have produced a 100% pure Java
implementation of the JavaHL interface.  Making it a drop in replacement for
the native library version of JavaHL.  The Subclipse distribution currently
provides an adapter option for this library.  The JavaSVN library <a
href="http://tmate.org/svn/licensing/index.html">license</a> is not compatible
with the EPL, so we will not provide this library or its adapter as part
of the project.  We will work with TMate to assist them in providing a
plug-in that is downloadable via their web site that adds JavaSVN as an adapter
option via our public extension point.  This has always been the option that
TMate has expressed as their preference, and they have asked to be listed
as both a supporter and interested party of this project.  External packagers
of Eclipse plug-ins, such as Linux distribtions and/or Yoxos would likely be
able to include JavaSVN in their distributions as the JavaSVN license would
be compatible with what they are doing.</p>

<p>The core plugin (<b>org.eclipse.team.svn.core</b>) is the Eclipse Team 
provider implementation for Subversion.  It provides access to SVN instances 
that are managed by the current worksapce.  The core plugin allows the team 
provider to function in a headless environment.  The Buckminster project
currently uses Subclipse in this manner, and they are also listed as an
interested party for this project.</p>

<p>Finally, the ui plugin (<b>org.eclipse.team.svn.ui</b>) provides user 
interaction for the core plugin.</p>

<h2>Organization</h2>

<p>This project will be organized as follows:</p>
	
<p><b>Initial committers</b></p>
<p>The initial committers will focus on refactoring the existing Subclipse code
base to meet the initial objectives of this project.  The initial committers
are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mark Phippard (<a href="http://www.softlanding.com/">SoftLanding 
	Systems</a>):  Project Lead</li>
	<li>Brock Janiczak</li>
	<li>Stephen Elsemore (<a href="http://www.softlanding.com/">SoftLanding
	Systems</a>)</li>
	<li>Paul Thiel (<a href="http://www.softlanding.com/">SoftLanding
	Systems</a>)</li>
	<li>Eugene Kuleshov</li>
	<li>Martin Letenay</li>
	<li>Daniel Bradby</li>
	<li>Jesper Steen Møller</li>
	<li>Alexander Kitaev (<a href="http://tmate.org/svn/">TMate</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Interested parties</b></p>
<p>The following Eclipse projects have previously worked with the Subclipse
project and have expressed an interest in this proposal.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Mylar</li>
	<li>Buckminster</li>
	<li>ALF</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Developer community</b></p>
<p>The Subclipse project has a proven track record of being able to attract and
support contributions from the developer community.  The Subclipse 1.0 release
listed thirty-seven individuals that made code contributions to the project.  
We expect to continue this tradition and likely expand it greatly as the 
visibility of the project in the Eclipse community is likely to increase as a 
result of this process.</p>

<p><b>User community</b></p>
<p>As with the Developer community, Subclipse has a proven track record of 
having a vibrant user community that has always provided valuable assistance to
the development process as well as assistance in supporting one another in a 
respectful and professional manner.  The Subversion project itself for that 
matter has set a high standard of excellence in this area, which other projects
have followed.</p>
	
<h2>Tentative Plan</h2>
	
<ul>
	<li>September 2006: Refactored and relicensed code contribution based on
	Subclipse</li>
	<li>December 2006: Initial release as an Eclipse project, supporting
	Eclipse 3.2.</li>
	<li>January 2007: Join the release train for Eclipse 3.3</li>
