<h1>SVN Team Provider Project</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The SVN Team Provider Project is a proposed open source project 
under the <a href="/technology/">Eclipse Technology Project</a>.</p>

<p>This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the
<a href="/projects/dev_process/"> Eclipse Development Process 
document</a>) and is written to declare its intent and scope. This proposal
is written to solicit additional participation and  input from the Eclipse
community. You are invited to comment on and/or join the project. Please 
send all feedback to the <a href="news://news.eclipse.org/eclipse.technology.svn">
news://news.eclipse.org/eclipse.technology.svn</a> newsgroup.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Subversion (SVN) is very popular and will soon overtake CVS as the most 
widely used open source version control system. Many hosting services are 
providing SVN access, and several major open source projects have converted
their CVS repositories to SVN. Eclipse has great support for CVS, and users
are looking for similar support for SVN.  Eclipse has no support for SVN out
of the box, which compares poorly to competitorrs such as Netbeans and IDEA.
Many new users will not know that they can download a 3rd party plugin to add
SVN support.</p>
<p>In addition to adding SVN support to Eclipse, there is the issue of providing
a solid Team API that can be leveraged by commercial and open source SCM
providers.  The current Team API is very capable, but at the same time it is 
also hindered by having only one concrete implementation.  In many instances
the API has become very CVS centric.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the issue of providing support for SVN to projects hosted
by Eclipse.org.  The code for this project should be hosted in an SVN repository
and it is likely that there are other projects currently hosted at Eclipse.org that
would like to migrate their repositories from CVS to SVN.  Part of this proposal is
to provide resources and expertise that will support the Eclipse Foundation in their
efforts to provide these services to the community.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>The objectives of the SVN Team Provider project are to: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Provide support for accessing and manipulating projects that are hosted in
	a Subversion repository.</li>
	<li>Provide UI and features that are familiar to existing Eclipse CVS users, while
	at the same time providing appropriate UI and access to SVN-specific features.</li>
	<li>Provide accurate and up to date documentation on using the features of the SVN 
	provider.</li>
	<li>Support, implement and follow the latest best practices for Eclipse UI development
	as appropriate for the current Eclipse release.</li>
    <li>Contribute to the development and refinement of the Eclipse Core Team API.</li>
	<li>Assist resources at the Eclipse Foundation in offering SVN hosting to projects.</li>
	<li>Assist the release engineering team to add SVN support to their tools and process.</li>
</ul>
	
<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Organization</h2>
	
<p><b>Initial committers</b></p>
<p>The initial committers will focus on refactoring the existing Subclipse code base to meet
the initial objectives of this project.  The initial committers are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mark Phippard</li>
	<li>Brock Janiczak</li>
	<li>Stephen Elsemore</li>
	<li>Paul Thiel</li>
	<li>Eugene Kuleshov</li>
	<li>Martin Letenay</li>
	<li>Daniel Bradby</li>
	<li>Jesper Steen MÃ¸ller</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Interested parties</b></p>
<p>The following Eclipse projects have previously worked with the Subclipse project and have
expressed an interest in this proposal.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Mylar</li>
	<li>Buckminster</li>
	<li>ALF</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Developer community</b></p>
<p>The Subclipse project has a proven track record of being able to attract and support contributions
from the developer community.  The Subclipse 1.0 release listed thirty-seven individuals that made
code contributions to the project.  We expect to continue this tradition and likely expand it greatly
as the visibility of the project in the Eclipse community is likely to increase as a result of this
process.</p>

<p><b>User community</b></p>
<p>As with the Developer community, Subclipse has a proven track record of having a vibrant user
community that has always provided valuable assistance to the development process as well as assistance
in supporting one another in a respectful and professional manner.  The Subversion project itself for
that matter has set a high standard of excellence in this area, which other projects have followed.</p>
	
<h2>Tentative Plan</h2>
	
<ul>
	<li>September 2006: Refactored and relicensed code contribution based on Subclipse</li>
	<li>December 2006: Initial release as an Eclipse project, supporting Eclipse 3.2.</li>
	<li>January 2007: Join the release train for Eclipse 3.3</li>
	<li>July 2007: Possibly move project to Eclipse Plaform</li>
</ul>
