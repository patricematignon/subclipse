<h1 style="text-align: center">Subclipse Ideas for Google Summer of Code</h1>

<p>
This page contains ideas for Google Summer of Code students.  The items on this page are the ideas that we think would be the best
projects for a SoC student and which would provide a lot of value to Subclipse.  However, don't take these as gospel! We welcome 
discussion on creative proposals. Don't hesitate to ask for details or start discussing one of these tasks on the <a href="mailto:dev@subclipse.tigris.org">dev@subclipse.tigris.org</a> 
mailing list (see <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">here</a> for subscription information).
</p>
<p><b>
In fact, please do discuss your task on the mailing list: regardless of whether you start discussing before or after submitting your
application, a demonstrated willingness to engage with the rest of the Subclipse development community will be considered favorable
in evaluating your application!

<div class="h2" id="revision-graph" title="revision-graph">
<h2>Revision Graph</h2>
<p>
It would be useful if the history of a file or folder could be viewed as a
revision graph.  Eclipse, via the Graphical Editor Framework (GEF), gives us the
tools we need to present a rich presentation of a revision graph.  The challenge is
really in Subversion, and what it would take to get the information we need to present
a proper graph.
</p>
<p>
TortoiseSVN probably has the closest proximation of the feature we want to add
and the challenges that will involve.  Because of the amount of information they
have to pull from the repository to create the graph, they created a local
cache.  We may need to do the same.  Alternatively, we could work with the
Subversion community to define the API's we need to get the information on demand.
</p>
<p>
<em>Expected difficulty:</em> Potentially High due to the Subversion limitations.  This would be a
very fun project though and would be well-received by our community.<br />

<h2>Subversion 1.5 Changelists</h2>
<p>
Subversion 1.5 added support for a local changelist feature that is functionally very similar to the existing Subclipse change set support
in the Synchronize view.  This task involves tying the two features together so that a user can switch between Subclipse and the
command-line or other tools and still see the changelist membership for a given set of files.  The Subclipse change set support includes
the ability to add folders to a change set, as well as associate a commit message.  Those features cannot be lost.<br />

<div class="h2" id="eclipse-api" title="eclipse-api">
<h2>Implement Eclipse File System and History Provider API</h2>
<p>
Eclipse 3.2 introduced some new API and abstractions that are available for team and filesystem providers to implement.  There are probably
some internal simplifications we could make within Subclipse if we implemented these API, but the main benefit would be for third parties
that want to build applications on top of these API's and have their application work properly for CVS, Subversion or any other tool that
properly implements the API.<br />
See Issue#: <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=513">513</a> for more details.

<div class="h2" id="synch-view" title="synch-view">
<h2>Rewrite Synchronize View to use new Logical Model API</h2>
<p>
In Eclipse 3.2 the CVS plug-in re-wrote their Synchronize view implementation to use a new API, called the Logical Model API.  This
allows alternate presentations of information in the view, such as Java-specific, generic resource, changesets etc.  Presumably other
"models" can be added easily or would automatically appear if present (such as a Ruby model).  The main benefit for Subclipse, is to
be supporting the new API.  To the user, the presentation of their changes in the view closely matches the presentation from the model-specific
views they are used to seeing.<br />

<div class="h2" id="nested-projects" title="nested-projects">
<h2>Nested Eclipse Projects</h2>
<p>
Eclipse 3.2 introduced the ability to have nested projects.  A master project that contains child projects that can also exist in your
workspace.  Subclipse has problems with that feature and this task is about fixing those problems.  This problem is gaining more and more
prominence as Maven users tend to use this feature and the popularity of Maven among Eclipse users seems to be on the rise.<br />
