<p>This page contains ideas for Google Summer of Code students.</p>

<div class="h2" id="revision-graph" title="revision-graph">
<h2>Revision Graph</h2>
<p>
Using technologies such as the Eclipse Graphical Editor Framework (GEF), create a revision graph
feature for Subclipse.

<div class="h2" id="changelists" title="changelists">
<h2>Subversion 1.5 Changelists</h2>
<p>
Subversion 1.5 added support for a local changelist feature that is functionally very similar to the existing Subclipse change set support
in the Synchronize view.  This task involves tying the two features together so that a user can switch between Subclipse and the
command-line or other tools and still see the changelist membership for a given set of files.  The Subclipse change set support includes
the ability to add folders to a change set, as well as associate a commit message.  Those features cannot be lost.

<div class="h2" id="nested-projects" title="nested-projects">
<h2>Nested Eclipse Projects</h2>
<p>
Eclipse 3.2 introduced the ability to have nested projects.  A master project that contains child projects that can also exist in your
workspace.  Subclipse has problems with that feature and this task is about fixing those problems.  This problem is gaining more and more
prominence as Maven users tend to use this feature and the popularity of Maven among Eclipse users seems to be on the rise.
