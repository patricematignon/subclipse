<p>Here you will find a screenshot tour of the Subclipse installation
process in Eclipse 3.x.  These particular screens were captured in
Eclipse 3.0.2 running on Windows XP.</p>

<div class="h2" id="install" title="install">
<h2>Install Subclipse in Eclipse 3.x</h2>

<h3>Step 1:</h3>
<p>Begin the installation from the Eclipse Help menu item.</p>
<img src="images/install-1.png" alt="Install screen" />

<h3>Step 2:</h3>
<p>This screenshot show the screen as it initially comes up.  In this case
you will need to change the radio button to indicate that this is a new install.</p>
<img src="images/install-2.png" alt="Install screen" />

<h3>Step 3:</h3>
<p>This screen will vary depending on the features you have installed already.  You want
to click on the New Remote Site button.  If you are behind a proxy and the Eclipse install
mechanism does not work, then you can download a zipped version of the update site and then
click the New Local Site button instead.</p>
<img src="images/install-3.png" alt="Install screen" />

<h3>Step 4:</h3>
<p>This screen is showing the New Remote Site dialog, filled in with the correct information
to install Subclipse</p>
<pre>
    Name: Subclipse
    URL:  http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.0.x
</pre>
<img src="images/install-4.png" alt="Install screen" />

<h3>Step 5:</h3>
<p>When you first come back to this screen, the site you added will NOT be selected.  Be sure
to select it before clicking Next.</p>
<img src="images/install-5.png" alt="Install screen" />

<h3>Step 6:</h3>
<p>This next screen shows all of the features that are available to install.</p>
<img src="images/install-6.png" alt="Install screen" />

<h3>Step 7:</h3>
<p>Click the button to accept the license agreement.</p>
<img src="images/install-7.png" alt="Install screen" />

<h3>Step 8:</h3>
<p>Confirm the install location</p>
<img src="images/install-8.png" alt="Install screen" />

<h3>Step 9:</h3>
<p>There is an Eclipse preference to turn off this next dialog.  I have never
seen a signed feature.  Not even Eclipse.org nor IBM sign their features.</p>

<h3>Step 10:</h3>
<p>Just a screenshot of the in-process installation.</p>
<img src="images/install-10.png" alt="Install screen" />

<h3>Step 11:</h3>
<p>Eclipse needs to be restarted after installing Subclipse.</p>
<img src="images/install-11.png" alt="Install screen" />

<h3>Step 12:</h3>
<p>Finally, after restarting Eclipse, the first thing you will typically want to do is
open the Subclipse Repository perspective where you can define your repositories.  Be
sure to also check the online help as well as the Subclipse preferences located under
Team -> SVN.</p>

<div class="h2" id="update" title="update">
<h2>Updating Subclipse in Eclipse 3.x</h2>

<p>Eclipse 3.x has a feature in preference to automatically check for updates.  Provided you
are not behind a proxy that does not allow this feature, it should work for Subclipse.  Otherwise
just follow the instructions for installing Subclipse, except take the option to check for updates
in Step 2.<br><br>
If you are behind a proxy that does not work with Eclipse, then to install updates you just
always follow the same instructions you used to install a new version.  If you always unzip
the site to the same local folder, you will not have to define the local site each time.</p>
