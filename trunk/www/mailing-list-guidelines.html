>Guidelines for Posting to the Subclipse Mailing Lists</h1>

<p>This document is based on years of experience with the Subversion
mailing lists, and specifically addresses the problems seen most
frequently on those lists.  It should <i>not</i> be taken as a
complete guide to mailing list etiquette&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;you can <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22mailing+list+etiquette%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search"
>find one of those on the Net</a> pretty easily if you want one.</p>

<p>If you follow these conventions when posting to the
users@subclipse.tigris.org or dev@subclipse.tigris.org mailing
lists, your post is much more likely to be read and answered.</p>

<div class="h2" id="where" title="where">
<h2>Where to post:</h2>

<p>Post to <a href="mailto:users@subclipse.tigris.org"
>users@subclipse.tigris.org</a> if you have a question about
Subclipse, or if you think you've found a bug (developers read the
users list too, so they'll see your bug report).  If you want to
discuss Subclipse development, or post a <a href="#patches">code
contribution</a>, then mail <a
href="mailto:dev@subclipse.tigris.org">dev@subclipse.tigris.org</a>.</p>

<p>When in doubt, mail users@, not dev@.</p>

<div class="h2" id="patches" title="patches">
<h2>Sending patches:</h2>

<p>If you're posting a patch, start the subject line with
<tt>[PATCH]</tt>.  This helps us spot patches right
away.  If the patch addresses a particular issue, include the issue
number as well: "<tt>[PATCH]&nbsp;issue&nbsp;#329: ...</tt>".
Developers who are interested in that particular issue will know to
read the mail.</p>

<p>If you can, send your patch as an attachment, using a mime-type of
text/x-diff, text/x-patch, or text/plain.  Most people's mailreaders
can display those inline, and having it as an attachment allows them
to extract the patch from the message conveniently.</p>

<p>If you can't attach the patch with a reasonable mime-type, or if
the patch is very short, then it's okay to include it directly in the
body of your message.  But watch out: some mail editors can munge
inline patches by inserting unasked-for line breaks in the middle of
long lines.  If you think your mail software might do this, then the
patch must be sent as as an attachment.</p>

<div class="h2" id="encodings" title="encodings">
<h2>Languages and encodings:</h2>

<p>Please use ASCII or ISO-8859 text if possible.  Don't post HTML
mails, RichText mails, or other formats that might be opaque to
text-only mailreaders.  Regarding language: we don't have an
English-only policy, but you will probably get the best results by
posting in English&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;it is the language shared by the
greatest number of list participants.</p>

<div class="h2" id="archives" title="archives">
<h2>Look before you post:</h2>

<p>Look in the FAQ, and maybe poke around in the mailing list
archives, before asking a question.  The Subclipse FAQ is here: <a
href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/faq.html"
>http://subclipse.tigris.org/faq.html</a>.  The mailing lists
archives are here: <a
href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/servlets/SearchList?listName=users"
>http://subclipse.tigris.org/servlets/SearchList?listName=users</a>
(for <tt>users@</tt>), and <a
href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/servlets/SearchList?listName=dev"
>http://subclipse.tigris.org/servlets/SearchList?listName=dev</a>
(for <tt>dev@</tt>).</p>
