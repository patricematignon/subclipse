<p>The documentation for Subclipse is included when you install the plugin
into Eclipse.  To view the documentation bring up the Eclipse help system and
open the Subclipse section from the Table of Contents.  In addition, most Subclipse
dialogs and views have context-sensitive help associated with them.  Just press
the Help activation key for your operating system, such as F1.  A brief bit of help
with relevant links into the documentation should be provided.</p>

<p>You can also view the same documentation online at: <a href="http://svn.collab.net/subclipse/help/index.jsp">
