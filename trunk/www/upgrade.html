<h1 style="text-align: center;">Upgrading Subclipse Release</h1>

<p>The recommended procedure to upgrade Subclipse to a new 1.x to 1.y release is to follow the first-time
install instructions.  Enter the update site URL for the new release stream into the Eclipse update manager
and this will install the new version on top of your existing installation.  This process works more reliably
than asking Eclipse to check for updates.
