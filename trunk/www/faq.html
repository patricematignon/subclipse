<h2>General questions:</h2>

<![CDATA[-----------------------------------------------------------]]>

<div class="h3" id="why" title="why">
<h3>Why does this project exist?</h3>

<p>Subclipse exists to provide an outstanding user interface to Subversion from
within the Eclipse IDE.  We aim to provide a client that is every bit as robust
and user-friendly as the outstanding CVS client that comes with Eclipse.  That being said,
there are a lot of major technical differences between Subversion and CVS.  Therefore, we
try to strike a balance between providing a UI that will be familiar to experienced Eclipse
CVS users, and one that is appropriate for the Subversion action being exposed.  In particular,
the way that Subversion handles branches and tags is very, very different from CVS.  Consequently
the UI for these features in Subclipse is different than the UI for the CVS client.</p>

</div>

<![CDATA[-----------------------------------------------------------]]>

<div class="h3" id="version" title="version">
<h3>Does Subclipse support Eclipse X.Y or Websphere Studio X.Y?</h3>

<p>Subclipse should support any IDE or application that is built on the Eclipse
framework.  The Subclipse feature has the appropriate &lt;requires&gt; tags to define
the Eclipse features that we require.  The current version of Subclipse supports
Eclipse 3.x.  There is an older version of Subclipse that supports Eclipse 2.x and applications
that are based on it, such as WebSphere Studio 5.x.  That version of Subclipse is no longer
supported or actively developed.
</p>

</div>

<div class="h3" id="adapter" title="adapter">
<h3>What is an adapter?  What is JavaHL?</h3>

<p>Unlike CVS, which does not have an official API, Subversion was designed from the
start to be an API.  Subversion is written (in C) as a set of libraries.  Subversion then provides
a default UI, in the form of a command line interface, that uses these libraries.  Subversion
also provides language bindings for various programing languages so that these same libraries can
be used in your language of choice.  JavaHL is the name of the Java language binding provided by
the Subversion project.  JavaHL is an official part of the Subversion project, not the Subclipse project.<br><br>
svnClientAdapter is a Java project that was developed for Subclipse.  It provides an even higher level
of abstraction to the Subversion libraries.  It also allows for different ways of accessing Subversion
functionality.  Historically, these two options were to use the JavaHL library or the Subversion
command line.  Recently, a third option was added and that is to use the <a href="http://tmate.org/svn/">
JavaSVN</a> library which is a 100% Pure Java implementation of the protocols used by Subversion.  
This option has the advantage of not requiring any native libraries installed on the client.  Of course,
since JavaSVN does not utilize the Subversion libraries it does not have the guaranteed compatability that
you can expect from JavaHL or the command line adapters.  That being said, JavaSVN is tested against the same
test suite that tests the Subversion command line, and passes those tests.<br><br>
JavaSVN does not support the file:/// protocol and isn't likely to in the future.</p>

</div>

<![CDATA[-----------------------------------------------------------]]>

<div class="h3" id="adapter-choice" title="adapter-choice">
<h3>Which adapter should I use?</h3>

<p>If the JavaHL library is available on your system, or easily attainable, then it is
probably the best choice.  That being said, JavaSVN is a great option.  The command line
adapter should only be used as a last resort.  Namely, if you cannot get JavaHL installed
and you absolutely have to have file:// protocol support to your repository.</p>

<h2>How-to:</h2>

<![CDATA[-----------------------------------------------------------]]>

<div class="h3" id="checkout" title="checkout">
<h3>How do I check out the Subclipse code?</h3>

<p>The URL for the Subclipse repository is http://subclipse.tigris.org/svn/subclipse/.  If
you have at least the Observer role in the Subclipse project, then provide your tigris.org
username and password when prompted.  Otherwise use a value of "guest" for each.  Subclipse
development is currently active on trunk.</p>

</div>

<![CDATA[-----------------------------------------------------------]]>

<div class="h3" id="repository" title="repository">
<h3>How do I create a repository?  How do I import data into it?</h3>

<p>Subclipse does not provide anything that allows you to create a Subversion repository.  That
action has to be performed outside of Eclipse.  Within Subclipse, you define a "connection" to
an already existing repository.  Defining a connection is one of the first things you should do
when using Subclipse.  This is done from the Subclipse Repository Exploring perspective.
</p>

<p>As for importing data, there are numerous ways it can be done, including doing it from outside
of Eclipse.  Assuming you have an existing project in your Eclipse workspace that you want to add to
your repository, you need to right-click on the project and do Team -&gt; Share Project.  Then follow
the wizard.
</p>

</div>
<div class="h3" id="cvs2svn" title="cvs2svn">
<h3>How do I convert an existing CVS repository
    into a Subversion repository?</h3>

<p>Members of the Subversion development community created and
maintain a tool called cvs2svn.  You can find it at <a
href="http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/">http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/</a>.  Be
sure to read the <a
href="http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/cvs2svn.html">cvs2svn documentation</a>.

</p>

<p>If cvs2svn.py does not work for you, (e.g. your repository
causes it to crash, or it doesn't deal with branches and tags
quite how you would like), there are at least two other
conversion utilities you can try.  These have different features
(and possibly different bugs):</p>

<ul>

<li>One based on <a
href="http://public.perforce.com/public/revml/index.html">VCP</a>
written by Chia-liang Kao can be found on <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?VCP::Dest::svk">CPAN</a>.</li>

<li>refinecvs written by Lev Serebryakov is at <a
href="http://lev.serebryakov.spb.ru/refinecvs/"

<h2>Troubleshooting:</h2>

<![CDATA[-----------------------------------------------------------]]>

<div class="h3" id="get-javahl" title="get-javahl">
<h3>How do I get the JavaHL library for my operating system?</h3>

<p><b>Windows:</b>&nbsp;JavaHL is included as part of Subclipse.  You do not
need to do anything.</p>

<p><b>OS X:</b>&nbsp;We recommend that you install the Metissian Subversion package.
This package includes JavaHL and installs everything in a way that it is recognized by Subclipse.
Download the package at <a href="http://metissian.com/projects/macosx/subversion/">
http://metissian.com/projects/macosx/subversion/</a>.</p>

<p><b>Linux:</b>&nbsp;The answer varies by distribution and the packaging mechanism.  In general
most distributions do NOT include the JavaHL library in their Subversion package.  In most cases,
you can download the source package and alter the build spec to build JavaHL.</p>
<p>There are Debian packages available for Subversion with JavaHL enabled. 
The packages are provided by http://www.ggtools.net/.  Here is the sources.list entry:
<pre> 
deb http://www.ggtools.net/files/debian/unstable/ ./
</pre>
</p>
<p><b>Others:</b>&nbsp;If your packaging mechanism does not include the JavaHL library, then
you probably need to build the library from source.</p>

</div>

<![CDATA[-----------------------------------------------------------]]>

<div class="h3" id="build-javahl" title="build-javahl">
<h3>How do I build JavaHL from source?</h3>

<p>JavaHL is part of the Subversion project.  So to begin, you probably want to download
the latest source tarball.  See: <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html">
http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html</a>.  You should refer to the Subversion instructions
for detailed information, but on a *nix system the general procedure is this:
<pre>
./configure --your-other-flags=here --enable-javahl --with-jdk=$JAVA_HOME\
     --with-jikes=$JAVA_HOME/bin/javac &&make && install install-javahl
</pre>
The main part to check before running the above command is "--your-other-flags". 
You will typically at least want --enable-ssl.
</p>

<div class="h3" id="library-path" title="library-path">
<h3>I think I have a valid JavaHL library installed, but Subclipse
    says it is not found.  What should I do?</h3>

<p>Starting with Subclipse 0.9.33 we now show the errors that occurred when loading
the JavaHL library.  To see these errors open the Eclipse preferences and go to Team-&lt;SVN.
Then click on JavaHL in the adapter section, the error messages should appear in a dialog.<br><br>
On *nix systems the problem is almost always that the JavaHL library was not found in the java.library.path.
The Sun JVM only looks in the value of LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and on many *nix systems this value is not
defined.  The easiest workaround is to create a shell script that launches Eclipse:
<pre>
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:.
./eclipse
</pre>
Alternatively, you can also do something like this in your script:
<pre>
./eclipse -vmargs -Djava.library.path=/usr/local/lib
</pre>
</p>
