<h1>Subclipse Changelog</h1>
<p>This file documents all of the changes that have been made to <a
 href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/">Subclipse</a> beginning with the 1.1.0 release process.
Please visit <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/">
http://subclipse.tigris.org/</a> for the latest information on Subclipse.</p>
<p>The latest version of this file can be viewed directly from our
website at <a
 href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/subclipse_1.2.x/changes.html">
http://subclipse.tigris.org/subclipse_1.2.x/changes.html</a>. Please
note that the file on the website may contain information about changes
that have not yet been made available in a release. Generally, these changes
will be available in the next release but it is also possible that a change
will be pulled out due to testing problems.</p>
<p>The log of changes leading up to the 1.1.0 release can be viewed <a
 href="../subclipse/changes.html">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> As of Subclipse 1.1.0, the minimum Eclipse requirement is now 3.2.0.  Subclipse
1.1.0 was built on Eclipse 3.2 RC6.  Presumably it will work with most earlier releases of 3.2.</p> 

<p><b>NOTE:</b> Subclipse 1.1.0 removed the SVN Resource History view as we now use the common Team
History view.  You will likely get an Eclipse error message if you use an existing workspace that had
that view open.  This is normal and is not a problem.  You will get the error the first time you open
each perspective that had the view open.</p>
