<h1 style="text-align: center;">What Needs Doing?</h1>

<p>There are a lot of different things you can do to help Subclipse.
Not all involve coding; there are plenty of non-programming roles for
eager volunteers.</p>

<p>Below are some of the needs we've identified, but please don't take
these as gospel!  New volunteers bring fresh viewpoints, and one of
the most important things you can do is point out a need we hadn't
recognized before&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and then fill it.</p>

<!-- ============================================================= -->
<div class="h2" id="faq-management" title="faq-management">
<h2>FAQ Management</h2>

<p>We need a FAQ manager.  A FAQ manager is someone who stays
subscribed to the <a
href="mailto:users@subclipse.tigris.org">users@subclipse.tigris.org</a>
and <a href="mailto:dev@subclipse.tigris.org"
>dev@subclipse.tigris.org</a> mailing lists, watches for common
questions or addenda to existing questions, and slowly adjusts the
Subclipse <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> in response to the problems
users are having "in the wild".  This is also a great way to get
familiar with Subclipse usage patterns and common problems.  If you
use Subclipse anyway, helping to manage the FAQ is a
great way to expand your troubleshooting skills.</p>

<p>This is not necessarily a formal role, or a single person.  Anyone can
submit a patch for the FAQ.  Please post to the <a
href="mailto:dev@subclipse.tigris.org">dev@subclipse.tigris.org</a>
mailing list if you're interested in this.</p>

<h2>Online Help Maintenance</h2>

<p>The Subclipse help system within Eclipse is just simple HTML.  Having
a good, up-to-date, help system is a large task.  Any assistance that
can be provided in maintaining the online help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
