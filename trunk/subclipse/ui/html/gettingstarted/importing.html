<h1>Import a Project into a Subversion Repository</h1>
<p>
Create a simple project that contains a few files so they can be stored in the Subversion Repository. 
A good test is to create a sample plug-in project by selecting <b>File->New->Project..</b> and <b>Plug-in Development->Plug-in Project</b>
Give the project a name and click through to finish on the wizard.
</p>
<p>
Next select the project you want to import and right click to select <b>Team->Share Project...</b>. 
This will bring the share project wizard dialog. Select <b>SVN</b> as the repository type and click <b>next</b>. 
Then use the <b>existing repository location</b> and click <b>next</b> again. Select <b>Use project name as module name</b> and click <b>finish</b>
This will make a remote directory in the repository and checkout that into the project to create all the .svn metadata directories
</p>
<p>
<b>Right click</b> on the newly shared project and select <b>Refresh</b> (TODO fix this). 
You should now see the project decorated with the repository URL
Then select the lop level files and directories to be added and <b>Right Click->Team->Add to Version Control</b>. 
You should see the <b>*</b> decoration to indicate an added but not commited resource.
With the same resources still selected <b>Right click->Team->Commit..</b>. 
You will prompted with a dialog that you can enter a commit comment (eg initial commit) and click <b>OK</b>
The project has now been imported into the Subversion repository!
