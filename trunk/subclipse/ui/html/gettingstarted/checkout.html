<h1>Checking out a Project</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    Check out is the term used to describe the process of making a copy of a
        project from a repository into your local workspace. In SVN, the check
        out process creates a <a href="../reference/glossary.html#working">working
        copy</a>. A working copy is a specially formatted folder structure which
        contains additional .svn folders that store SVN information, as well
        as a <a href="../reference/glossary.html#pristine">pristine copy</a> of
        each item that is checked out.
</p>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>
    Navigate to the <span class="name"><a href="../reference/svn-repository.html">SVN
    Repository Exploring Perspective</a></span>. If you have not already defined
    a connection to your repository, you will need to <a href="new-location.html">add
    a new repository location</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Once you have defined a repository location, click on it to expand the location
        and navigate the contents of your repository.
</p>
<p>
    Locate the folder containing the project that you want to check out and then<span class="action"> right
    click</span> on the project to bring up the context menu.

<h3>Check out as Project</h3>
<p>
    If the project in your repository already contains an Eclipse <span class="code">.project</span> file
    as well as any other Eclipse-specific files that are needed, such as the <span class="code">.classpath</span> file
    used by Java projects, then you would want to use the <span class="menu">Check
    Out As Project</span> option. This option will create an Eclipse project
    in your active workspace, based on the files in the repository. Since your
    repository already contains all of the required files, you should be all
    ready to start working once the checkout is complete.
</p>
<h3>Check Out Project Into ... </h3>
<p>
    This option works exactly as desctribed in the Check Out as Project option
        except that it allows you to select a target directory for the working
        copy that is outside your active Eclipse workspace.
</p>
<h3>Check out As ... </h3>
<p>
    If your repository does not contain an Eclipse <span class="code">.project</span> file,
    then you will want to use the <span class="menu">Check Out As ...</span> option.
    This option will run the Eclipse new project wizard and lets you establish
    a name for your project as well as the Eclipse project type.
</p>
<p>
    The Eclipse new project wizard creates the folder for your project as well
        as any special files that are needed for that project type, such as the <span class="filefolder">.project</span> and <span class="filefolder">.classpath</span> files,
        as well as any folders you may have told it to create. SVN may have to
        delete some of those files and folders before it can check out your project
        and the SVN checkout process will abort if it encounters a file or folder
        that already exists. When SVN sees that these extra files exist, it issues
        a warning message before it deletes anything. If you receive this warning
        message, and you want to preserve the local version of any of these files,
        you can copy any files out of the folder in your workspace (using your
        operating system's file explorer) and then copy them back after the checkout
        is complete; all before answering the message. In the long term, the
        best option is to then commit all of those special project files so that
        the next person can just use the <span class="menu">Check Oout As Project</span> option.
