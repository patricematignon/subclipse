<h1>Checking out a Project</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Check out is the term used to describe the process of getting a copy of your project from
your repository into your local workspace.  In Subversion, the check out process creates what
Subversion calls a working copy.  A working copy is a specially formatted folder structure
which contains extra .svn folders that store Subversion information, as well as a pristine
copy of each item that is checked out.  The working copy format is defined by Subversion and is
essential for all of the actions you will want to perform on your working copy.</p>
<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p>Navigate to the <a href="../reference/svn-repository.html">SVN Repository Exploring Perspective</a></p>
<p>If you have not already created a repository location, then you should see the section on 
<a href="new-location.html">Creating a Repository Location</a>.  Once you have a repository location
then click on it to expand the location and navigate the contents of your repository.</p>
<p>Find the folder containing the project that you want to check out and then
<b>Right click</b> on the project to bring up the context menu.  There are two common scenarios
and options that are supported for checkout:
<ol>
<li>The project in your repository already contains an Eclipse <tt>.project</tt> file as well as any other
Eclipse-specific files that are needed, such as the <tt>.classpath</tt> file used by Java projects.  If this
scenario applies to you then you want to take the <b>Checkout As Project</b> option.  This option will create
an Eclipse project in your workspace based on the files in your repository.  Since your repository
already contains all of the required files, you should be all ready to start working once the checkout
is complete.

</li>
<li>The project in your repository does not contain an Eclipse <tt>.project</tt> file.  If this scenario applies
to you then you want to take the <b>Checkout As ...</b> option.  This option will first run the Eclipse wizard
to create a new project.  This lets you establish the name for your project as well as the Eclipse project
type.
<p><b>NOTE:</b>  The Eclipse new project wizard creates the folder for your project as well as any special files
that are needed for that project type, such as the <tt>.project</tt> and <tt>.classpath</tt> files, as well as any
folders you may have told it to create.  Subclipse may have to delete some of those files and folders before it
can checkout your project.  Subclipse has to run the Subversion checkout process so that you have a proper Subversion
working copy when the process is finished.  The Subversion checkout process will abort if it encounters a file or
folder that already exists.  Before Subclipse runs the checkout process it will delete any files and folders that
exist locally and also exist in the location that you are checking out.  When Subclipse sees that these extra files
exist, it issues a warning message before it deletes anything. If you receive this warning message, and you want to
preserve the local version of any of these files, then before answering the message you can copy any files out of
the folder in your workspace (using your operating system's file explorer) and then copy them back after the checkout
is complete. In the long term, the best option is to then commit all of those special files so that the next person
can just use the <b>Checkout As Project</b> option.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Once the project is checked out, you can switch to a different perspective and start working.
The Team menu will automatically use the Subversion repository location for comparisons, updates, etc.
