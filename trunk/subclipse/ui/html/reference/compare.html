<h1>Compare With menu</h1>

<p>The compare menu normally allows you to compare with local history (Eclipse's own version of saved files during a session),
or to compare two selected resources.
<p>However, once a project is connected to a Subversion repository, a few new entries are present in the Compare menu:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Compare With &gt; Base Revision</b> - this will compare the selected resource with the "pristine" version hidden away in the
	project's working copy. This happens without contacting the repository.</li>
	<li><b>Compare With &gt; Latest From Repository</b> - this will compare the selected resource with the latest version
	    of this resource at the same location in the repository. This requires a lookup to see what the latest version is.
	</li>	
	<li><b>Compare With &gt; Previous From Repository</b> - TODO. this will compare the selected resource with the latest version
	    of this resource at the same location in the repository. This requires a lookup to see what the latest version is.
	</li>	
</ul>
<p>These comparisons are very useful for reviewing the contents of you changes before you commit them.
