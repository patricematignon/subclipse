<h1>Team &gt; Add to svn:ignore</h1>

<p>You can choose to let Subversion ignore certain resources (files or folders) in your working copy, such
as derived files (e.g. .class files compiled from Java source) and other files that do not belong
under version control. By ignoring them, Subclipse doesn't mark them as "unknown", and they no longer appear in
the Synchronize view.
<p>To ignore specific resources, select the file(s) and/or folder(s) you wish to ignore, and choose <b>Add to svn:ignore</b>
in the Team menu. This will bring up a selection where you may choose how to ignore the file:
<ul>
<li>By name (only the selected resource)</li>
<li>By wildcard extension (based on the selected resources)</li>
<li>By a custom pattern that you enter (e.g. <tt>log*.txt</tt>)</li>
</ul>
<p>When in doubt, choose the first option ("By resource name"), since that will never ignore a resource that wasn't explicitly selected and ignored.
