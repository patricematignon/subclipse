<h1>SVN Resource History View</h1>

<p>This view shows the history of a resource, as it exists in the Subversion repository.
In Subversion, both files and directories are versioned and have a history.
<p>If the resource selected is in a working copy, the revision currently checked out is highlighted (in boldface).
<p>The view itself consists of three areas:
<ul>
<li>The revision table - showing revision numbers, date/time of revision, the name of the committer, as well as the first line of the commit message. You can click on any revision to show its details.</li>
<li>The commit message for the selected revision.</li>
<li>The list of resources affected by this revision (that is: modified, added, deleted or changed properties)</li>
</ul>
<p>The SVN Resource History View can be linked with the current editor or not. If linked, the contents changes when you switch
which resource is being edited. If not linked, you must <a href="show-in-history.html">manually ask</a> to show the selected resource.
<p>
<em>Note</em>: Showing the history may be a longer running operation since it must retrieve the history from the repository.
If working with a remote repository on a WAN or on the internet, you might want to turn off the "Link with editor" button, or
explicitly close or hide the view when switching between resources in the editor.
