<h1>Team &gt; Disconnect...</h1>

<p>If you want to work completely independent of version control, you may disconnect your local copy of the project
from the repository. You can only disconnect entire projects, not individual folders or files.</p>

<p>When disconnecting, you can choose to keep the SVN working copy information around (<tt>.svn.</tt> folders).
If you do this, you can reconnect to the remote repository at a later timer, using <a href="share.html">Team &gt; Share...</a>.

<p>If you choose to delete the <tt>.svn</tt> folders, your project will be completely disconnected from Subversion.
