<h1>Disconnect</h1>
<p>
    This command is initiated via the <span class="menu">Team &gt; Disconnect
    ... </span>context menu option.
</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    If you want to work completely independent of version control, you may disconnect
        your local copy of the project from the repository. You can only disconnect
        entire projects, not individual folders or files.
</p>
<h2>Process</h2>

<p>
    Select the project root folder and select <span class="menu">Team &gt; Disconnect</span> from
    the context menu.
</p>
<p>
    A dialog is presented asking if you want to remove the SVN meta information
    from the file system. If you want to reconnect to the remote repository at
    a later time, <span class="action">choose</span> <span class="control">Do
    not delete the SVN meta information</span>. This is the default option.
</p>
<p>
    If you do choose to delete the SVN meta information, your project will be
    completely disconnected from SVN.  You will not be able to re-attach your project to the
    same repository location later.  If you think you might want to do that, then you should NOT
    delete the SVN meta information.
