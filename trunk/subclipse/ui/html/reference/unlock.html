<h1>Team &gt; Unlock</h1>

<p>You can use the Unlock command to release the lock on a file that you had previously locked.  The normal process
would be to commit your changes, which also releases the locks.  This action exists for the scenario where you have
locked a file and later decide you are not going to commit it.
</p>

<p>The unlock command is issued from the 'Team' context menu of the resource.</p>
