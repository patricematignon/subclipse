<h1>Relocate Repository</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    Sometimes an administrator might change the <em>base location</em> of your
    repository &mdash; in other words, the contents of the repository doesn't
    change, but the URL used to reach the root of the repository does. For example,
    the hostname may change, or the URL schema, or perhaps just the path which
    leads to the repository. Rather than checkout a new working copy, you can
    use the Relocate option to have SVN <em>rewrite</em> the the beginnings of
    all the URLs in your working copy. No file contents are changed, nor is the
    repository contacted.

    Relocate command should only used if the URL of the repository root has changed.
    This is a very infrequently used operation and should not be used to move
    to another SVN repository, nor should it be used to switch to another branch
    or directory within the same repository. An improperly used Relocate command
    may corrupt your working copy! The chances are, if you are unsure whether
    Relocate is the correct operation, it probably is not.
