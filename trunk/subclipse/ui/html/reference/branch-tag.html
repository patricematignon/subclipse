<h1>Branch/Tag</h1>
<p>
    This function is initiated via the <span class="menu">Team &gt; Branch/Tag...</span> menu
    option.
</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    You can use the Branch/Tag command for several different purposes:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        To create a snapshot copy of the current repository state (version) for
            later retrieval. This is usually called a <a href="glossary.html#tag">tag</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        To create a place for a new variation of the project as is exists in
            the repository. This is usually called a <a href="glossary.html#branch">branch</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        To save the state of the current <a href="glossary.html#working">working
        copy</a> as a new branch of the project. This is also called a <a href="glossary.html#branch">branch</a>.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>Process</h2>

<p>
    This command launches the same single-step Copy (Branch /Tag) operation as
        described in the <a href="copy-branch-tag.html"><span class="name">SVN
        Repository Explorer View</span></a>. The only difference is the availability
        of the working copy as a source for the copy operation.

</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Choose the project (or folder) which you want to copy (branch or tag).
    </li>
    <li>
        Choose the <span class="menu">Branch/Tag...</span> option from the Team
        context menu.
    </li>
    <li>
        Specify the target location for the copy operation or click <span class="control">Browse</span> to
        select the location in the repository.
    </li>
    <li>
        Select the source of the copy operation. If you are copying a specific
            revision in the repository, click <span class="control">Show Log</span> to
            choose the revision.
    </li>
    <li>
        The copy process is a commit operation. Enter a comment to be assocatied
            with the copy. This will be the initial message found on the new
            location.
    </li>
    <li>
        Click <span class="control">OK</span> to complete the branch or tag.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Selecting to create the branch or tag from your working copy enables you
    to save your work to a new repository location. This is likely to be useful
    if you started working on a change which you later decide be in a branch
    of its own. Another use is when you need to move really big changes between
    working copies (e.g. between development machines), and when moving a patch
    files becomes impractical.

<blockquote>
    <p>
        The process of creating a new branch or tag does not change or redirect
        your working copy to the new target path. To work on the newly created
        branch or tag, you will need to <a href="../reference/switch.html">switch</a> to
        it.
