<h1>Add keywords</h1>
<p>
    This dialog is accessed via the <span class="menu">Team &gt; Add keywords </span> menu
    or the <span class="menu">Add keywords </span> context menu option in the <span class="name">SVN
    Properties View</span>.
</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    Keywords in SVN are used to embed versioning information into files that
    are under version control. These keywords (like for instance, 'Id') are expanded
    for resources that are marked as using them, and this is what the "Add keywords" action
    does.  The action will set the svn:keywords property on the selected files.  This tells
    Subversion to look for an expand those keywords in the file.  Of course, it is up to you
    to include the keyword in the file in the place you want it to appear.

        case all the contained (child) resources are also affected - and choose <span class="menu">Add
        keywords</span> from the Team menu.

    <span class="action">Check</span> the keywords to associate with the selected
    resource(s). To use the keyword in a (text) file, enclose it in $-signs,
    as in <span class="code">$Id$</span>.
