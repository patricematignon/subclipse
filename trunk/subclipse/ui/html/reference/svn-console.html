<h1>SVN Console View</h1>

<p>The console page shows the communication with the Subversion repository, expressed as subcommands to the 'svn' program
(in fact, this is simulated output unless you use the "SVN Command line" interface as chosen on the 'Team &gt; SVN' preferences page)

<p>Using the preferences pages you may also control how (and when) the SVN Console view appears.</p>
