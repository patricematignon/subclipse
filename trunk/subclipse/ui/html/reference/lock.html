<h1>Team &gt; Lock</h1>

<p>Using the new features in Subversion 1.2, you can lock one or more files for editing. This is useful for
ensuring that two team members do not waste each others' time by editing the same resource if it is hard
or impossible to merge these changes (for instance with binary files).
</p>

<p>The lock command is issued from the 'Team' context menu of the resource.

<p>Once locked by you, the resource has a check-mark next to it.<br>

If you commit a change to a locked file, the lock is usuall unlocked, unless you select 'Keep locks' in
the <a href="../reference/commit.html">commit dialog</a>.
Alternatively, you can <a href="../reference/unlock.html">unlock</a> the resource again.</p>

<p>Subversion also makes it possible to <em>steal</em> a lock,
if a different user has locked a file and you need to take it over.
This is accomplished by selecting the 'Steal Lock' option found in the dialog.</p>

<blockquote>TIP: If you want to ensure that a specific file is <strong>always</strong> locked before committing,
you can set the Subversion property <tt>svn:needs-lock</tt> on the file (and commit). This ensures that a lock must
be taken before committing it.</blockquote>
