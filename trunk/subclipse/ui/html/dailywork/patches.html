	<h1>Creating and applying patches</h1>
	
	<p>Often, when work on a project is shared between many developers, you need to work with,
	review and mabye transfer changes that haven't been committed yet. For this, SVN
	offers the functionality to <a href="../reference/create-patch.html">create a patch</a>,
	which works with Eclipse's built-in <a href="../reference/apply-patch.html">apply patch</a>.
	<p>Patches are representations of changes to a given version of the repository state, and
	can easily be transferred to other developers, for instance when one developer (who doesn't have
	commit access) needs to submit a change to someone who can then review and commit it.</p>
	
	<h2>Creating a patch</h2>
	
	<p>Select your project or a folder/file and take the Team &gt; Create patch... option.  Save the patch to a file and distribute the file
	via email or whatever mechanism is appropriate.  NOTE:  To have new files included in your patch you must use the <a href="../reference/add.html">Team &gt;
	Add to Version Control</a> option prior to creating the patch.  This will tell SVN to include it in the patch.</p>
	
	<h2>Applying a patch</h2>
	
	<p>Select the project or a folder/file and take the Team &gt; Apply patch... option.  This will walk you through a wizard that lets you
	specify the patch location and then apply it to your working copy.</p>
