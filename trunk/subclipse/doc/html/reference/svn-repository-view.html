<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
    The SVN Repository view allows you to define and manage SVN repository locations
        within the Eclipse workbench. Repository files and folders are presented
        in a tree view with the top level of the tree representing a connection
        to a specific SVN Repository location. Once you have a location defined,
        you have access to a range of repository operations, including:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>History</dt>
    <dd>
        You can request to view the revision history for any file or folder in
            the repository.
    </dd>
    <dt>Checkout</dt>
    <dd>
        Checkout the repository location to your local workspace as a working
            copy.

    The context menu options available differ slightly depending on the entry
        selected in the SVN Repository View.
</p>
<h3>New &gt; New remote folder</h3>
<p>
    This menu option will evoke the <a href="new-remote-folder.html">New remote
    folder</a> wizard.
</p>
<h3>New &gt; Repository Location</h3>
<p>
    This menu option will evoke the <a href="../gettingstarted/new-location.html">Add
    a new SVN Repository</a> wizard.
</p>
<h3>History </h3>
<p>
    This menu option will show the revision history for the selected file or
        folder in the <a href="svn-history-view.html">History</a> view.
</p>
<h3>Create Unified Diff </h3>
<p>
    This menu option allows two files or folders to be selected for comparison.
        The output of the compare is saved to a file in <a href="glossary.html#unified">unified
        diff</a> format.
</p>
<h3>Check Out</h3>
<p>
    If a <span class="filefolder">.project</span> file is found in the selected
    directory, an option is available to <span class="menu">Check Out As Project</span>.
    This option will create a working copy in a new folder in your active workspace.
    If you want to create the working copy somewhere other than in your active
    workspace, you can use the <span class="menu">Check Out As Project Into</span> option.
    You can then specify an alternative target for the working copy. If there
    is no <span class="filefolder">.project</span> file in the selected directory,
    you can use the <span class="menu">Check Out As ... </span> option. This
    option will allow you to specify the type of project you wish to check out
    the location as and create a <span class="filefolder">.project</span> file
    for you in the working copy.
</p>
<h3>Export</h3>
<p>
    <a href="export-remote-folder.html">Export</a> (copy) the selected resources
    to a designated target location.
</p>
<h3>Import</h3>
<p>
    <a href="import-folder.html">Import</a> a local or networked resource into
    the repository.
</p>
<h3>Rename/move</h3>

    a remote resource</a> wizard.
</p>
<h3>Branch/Tag</h3>
<p>
    This option simplifies the copy and paste of repository resources by allowing
        you to complete the branch and tag process as a <a href="copy-branch-tag.html">single
        step operation</a>.
</p>
<h3>Copy/Paste</h3>
<p>
    These options allow you to copy and paste file and folder resources directly
        in the repository. Paste is a commit operation and you will prompted
        to enter a comment as part of the paste process.
</p>
<h3>Delete</h3>
<p>
    The delete option removes the selected resources from the repository. One
        or more files or folders can be selected for delete in a single operation.
        To select multiple resources, hold down the Shift and or Ctrl keys and
        click on the resources you want to delete. Delete is a commit operation
        and you will prompted to enter a comment as part of the delete process.
</p>
<h3>Copy URL to clipboard</h3>
<p>
    This option will copy the full repository URL for the selected resource to
        the Windows clipboard. This is useful if you want to share the repository
        URL with colleagues or reproduce the URL in an email, documentation or
        similar.
</p>
<h3>Properties</h3>

    and date.
</p>
<h3>Refresh View </h3>
<p>
    Refresh the SVN Repository View and update the display with the latest information
        from the repository.
</p>
<h3>Relocate</h3>
<p>
    The <a href="relocate-repository.html">Relocate</a> command is only used
    if the URL of the repository root has changed due to a server IP address
    change, protocol change (e.g. http:// to https://) or a change of the repository
    root path in the server setup.
