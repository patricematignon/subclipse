<h1>Using the synchronize view</h1>
<h2> Overview</h2>
<p>
    The synchronize view is useful if you want to see the overall status of your
        working copy against the state of the repository, including any updates.
        The view focuses on inbound and outbound changes, where <em>inbound</em> changes
        are the changes that others have committed and are coming in to your
        working copy when synchronizing. The <em>outbound</em> changes are the
        ones you did to your repository as a result of editing, removing or adding
        resources.
</p>
<p>
    In short, the synchronize view offers a different way of updating and commiting
        your work, and does so in a manner which <em>may</em> be more familar
        to you as an Eclipse user.
