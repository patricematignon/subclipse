<h1>Update</h1>
<p>
    This function is initiated via the <span class="menu">Team &gt; Update </span> menu
    option or from within the <span class="name">Team Synchronizing View</span>.
</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    While you are working on a project, other members of your team may be committing
        changes to the project repository. To get these changes, you have to <em>update</em> your <a href="glossary.html#working">working
        copy</a>. 
</p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>
    There are three different kinds of incoming changes:
</p>
<dl>
    <dl>
        <dt>Non-conflicting</dt>
        <dd>
            A non-conflicting change occurs when a file has been changed remotely
                but has not been modified locally.
        </dd>
        <dt>Conflicting, but auto-mergeable</dt>
        <dd>
            An auto-mergeable conflicting change occurs when an ASCII file has
            been changed both remotely and locally (i.e. has non-committed local
            changes) but the changes are on different lines.
        </dd>
        <dt>Conflicting</dt>
        <dd>
            A conflicting change occurs when one or more of the same lines of
                an ASCII file have been changed both remotely and locally. Binary
                files are never auto-mergeable and are conflicting by default.
        </dd>
    </dl>
</dl>
<p>
    When you perform an update, the contents of your working copy will be updated
        with the latest version of the resource available in the repository.
        For non-conflicting and auto-mergeable conflicts, there is no additional
        action required. The repository contents are not changed when you update
        When you accept incoming changes, these changes are applied to your working
        copy only. The repository is only changed when you commit your outgoing
        changes.
</p>
<p>
    In case a conflict is found, you may choose to <a href="revert.html">revert</a> your
    changes or edit and resolve the conflict using the Eclipse <a href="edit-conflicts.html">conflict
    editor</a>.
