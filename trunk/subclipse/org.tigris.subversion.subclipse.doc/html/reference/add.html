<h1>Add To Version Control</h1>
<p>
    This function is initiated via the <span class="menu">Team &gt; Add to Version
    Control </span> menu option.
</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    When you share a project for the first time, or when you add or import new
        resources to a project, you need to tell SVN that you want them <em>under
        version control</em>.
</p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    To do this, find and select the unversioned resource(s) that you want to
        add. These will typically be decorated by a little question mark <img src="../images/unknown.png" width="11" height="14"> in
        the Navigator view. Once you execute the <span class="name">Add to Version
        Control </span>process, the decoration will change to a small blue plus <img src="../images/add.png" width="13" height="15">.
        This indicates that your resource is scheduled for addition to the repository
        on the next commit.

<p>
    This operation does not contact the repository. Also, if the resources parent
        folder is not under version control, it will be added as well (all the
        way up to the project root, as needed).
</p>
<h2>Reverting files added in error</h2>
<p>
    If you add something to version control you didn't want to, don't panic;
        you can always undo (<a href="revert.html">Revert</a>) your changes. <em>Reverting</em> the
        added resource is often preferred over deleting the resource, since it
        is only the 'added'-state that you revert, not the creation of the file
        itself.

<blockquote>
    When you commit your changes back to the repository, you can short-cut the <span class="name">Add</span> command
    by simply <span class="action">checking</span> the unversioned resources
    in the <a href="commit.html">commit</a> dialog resource list. A <a href="preferences.html">preference</a> setting
    controls whether or not unversioned resources are checked by default during
    the commit operation.
