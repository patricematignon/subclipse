<h1>Team Synchronizing Perspective </h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    When you are working with complex projects in a team, it may be extremely
        hard to grasp the impact of your changes in relation to the changes committed
        by others. To help with this, the Eclipse IDE offers the <span class="name">Team
        Synchronizing Perspective</span>, which the SVN plug-in for Eclipse extends
        to support SVN repositories. To activate this perspective, choose <span class="menu">Window &gt; Open
        Perspective &gt; Other...</span> and select <span class="name">Team Synchronizing.</span> Alternatively,
        you can launch the persective directly from your <a href="glossary.html#working">working
        copy</a> via the <span class="menu">Team &gt; Synchronize...</span> context
        menu option.
</p>
<p>
    The concept of <em>team synchronization</em> is that of a cross-resource,
    three way merge in which you may consider all changes at once, and filter
    the information as needed before performing any updates or commits, with
    your existing working copy being the focal point. Your own local changes
    are called <em>outgoing</em> and the changes that have happened in the repository
    since your last update are called <em>incoming</em>. In the synchronization
    perspective, both incoming and outgoing changes are analyzed before they
    are <em>synchronized</em>; that is, for incoming changes, synchronization
    means that your working copy is updated (corresponds to <span class="menu">Team &gt; Update</span>)
    and for outgoing changes, synchronization means that your changes are committed.
</p>
<p>
    Launching the <span class="name">Team Synchronization Perspective</span> does
    not update or change the status of local or repository resources automatically.
</p>
<p>
    The <span class="name">Team Synchronizing Perspective</span> as a whole can
    be considered analogous to the output of <span class="code">svn status -u</span>.
</p>
<p>
    The T<span class="name">eam Synchronization Perspective</span> is a function
    of the Eclipse IDE. For a more detailed discussion of team synchronization,
    take a look at the help on <a href="../../../org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/reference/ref-33.htm">CVS
    workspace synchronization</a>.
