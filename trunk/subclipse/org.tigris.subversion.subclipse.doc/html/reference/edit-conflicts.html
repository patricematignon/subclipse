<h1>Edit Conflicts</h1>
<p>
    This function is initiated via the <span class="menu">Team &gt; Edit conflicts </span> context
    menu.
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    In order to commit changes in your working copy to the repository, your working
        copy must be up to date. This is achieved through the Update command.
        When you perform an update, the contents of your working copy are updated
        with the latest version of the resource available in the repository.
        If the inbound changes from the repository are non-conflicting, they
        are merged automatically into your working copy. However, where the resource
        is non-mergeable, or the same lines have changed in the resource both
        locally and in the repository, the resource is flagged as in conflict.

    The Eclipse platform provides a Compare Editor that allows you to review
        the imbound and outbound changes in a resource in addition to the lines
        that are in conflict. It also provides features that allow you to selectively
        merge the differences between the file variants.
