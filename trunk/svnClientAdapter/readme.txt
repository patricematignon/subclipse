svnClientAdapter
===========

SVNClientAdapter uses svnup Subversion library (http://svnup.tigris.org) to provide access to the Subversion API.
However, the version of svnup used is not the same than the one on the svnup web site. I use a modified version of svnup-0.5b for now.


svnClientAdapter is easier to use than SVNClient class and has more features.
