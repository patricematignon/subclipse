/**
 * This class implements a custom FileSet for ANT. It returns a set of files
 * based on the result of Subversion status command, as opposed to the list
 * of files actually on the file system. Two main differences:
 * <ol>
 * 	<li>Missing and deleted files are provided</li>
 *  <li>Internal subversion file (.svn) are skipped</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * This class is implemented as a subclass of org.apache.tools.ant.types.FileSet,
 * which is an opportunistic design, at best. However, it is necessary at the 
 * present time to go around practicality issues between ANT 1.6 (which does not
 * support custom filesets yet) and ANT 1.7 where a lot of changes are made to support 
 * custom filesets. For backward compatibility reasons, the new approach in ANT
 * will not be practical until much later, when we can safely assume that everyone 
 * is using at least ANT 1.7, and that the majority of the tasks based on filesets
 * have migrated to the new structure.
