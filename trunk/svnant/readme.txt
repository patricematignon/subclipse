svnant
=====

svnant uses svnup Subversion library (http://svnup.tigris.org) to provide access to the Subversion API.

However, the version of svnup used is not the same than the one on the svnup web site. I use a modified version of svnup-0.5b for now.


documentation of svn task is in /doc.

There is a test you can run in build.xml. For that modify test/build.properties and modify urlRepos. The run ant runTests in main directory


The binary jar is in build/lib
