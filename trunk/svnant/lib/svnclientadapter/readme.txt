
SVNClientAdapter
===============

SVNClientAdapter is a high-level Java API for Subversion.

It can use one of 3 low-level svn client implementations to provide access to the Subversion API:

- JavaHL (JNI) subversion library (http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/subversion/bindings/java/javahl/)
- SVNKit (pure Java) (http://svnkit.com/)
- svn(.exe) command line client (some functionality unavailable/unreliable with <1.3 command line clients)

SVNClientAdapter is easier to use than SVNClient class and has more features.

How to use it :
=============
You will need to add svnClientAdapter.jar in your classpath. 
If you wish to use JNI client (recommended), you will need svnjavahl.jar in your classpath.
If you wish to use pure java implementation of subversion low-level api, you will need svnkit.jar and ganymed.jar in your classpath.
If you wish to use command line client, you will need that client be present on your system path.

See the src/samples folder to see how to use it.
