<h1>Managing Passwords</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Subclipse allows you to store the username and password for your repository connection
in the connection itself.  Unless you are using the command line adapter to talk to Subversion,
it is better if you do not do this.  When using the JavaHL or JavaSVN adapters, you will be
prompted whenever the adapter needs your username and password.</p>

<p>As the previous screen shows, you will typically be given the option to have Subversion cache
your password.  On Windows, the password will be encrypted.  See <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch06s02.html#svn-ch-6-sect-2.2">
Client Credentials Caching</a> in the Subversion book for more information.</p>
<p>The chief benefit you get by allowing Subversion to manage your password is that it will
prompt you for a new password when the password has changed, and then cache that change.  If Subclipse
is storing your password, then Subversion will prompt you for a new password, but Subclipse will not
know that this has happened and it will keep using the old password, which means you will keep getting
prompted.  You can update the Subclipse password by invoking the Properties dialog for the stored
connection.</p>
