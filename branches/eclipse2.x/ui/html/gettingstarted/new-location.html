<h1>Creating a new Repository Location</h1>
To be able to work with a repository you will need to create a new repository location in the SVN Repository View. 
Invoke the wizard by right clicking inside the view and select <b>New->Repository Location...</b>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/new-location.jpg"/></p>
<p>
This will bring up a dialog that will prompt you for a repository location URL, username and password. 
Enter the URL of the repository you want to connect to (or use the file based one we created earlier <b>file:///g:/newrepos</b>)
</p>

<p>
After you click finish, the wizard will create the location and list any contents for the given URL. 
The screen shot below shows the new repository with nothing in it. It also shows the SVN console view with the issued list commands
