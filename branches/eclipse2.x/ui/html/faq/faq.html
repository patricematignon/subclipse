<h3>FAQ</h3>

<p>
	<strong>Is there a Linux version?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	A release of Subclipse has been made for Linux / Eclipse 3 
</p>


<p>
	<strong>What versions of Eclipse does Subclipse support ?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Subclipse has been tested against Eclipse 2.1.0, 2.1.1, and 3M4 for Windows. A release has also been made to support Eclipse 3 an upwards on Linux.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Why is Subclipse so particular about what version of Subclipse and Berkeley DB is used?</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Subclipse uses a JNI interface (<a href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/subversion/bindings/java/javahl/">javahl</a>) to Subversion. 
	The binaries that come with Subclipse are linked with particular versions when compiled. 
	If you want to use a different version of Subversion then you have two options. 
	You can either get Subclipse to use the command line client or you'll need to change the version of the Subversion libraries (libdb40.dll, libeay32.dll, ssleay32.dll, zlib.dll) and recompile the javahl library. 
</p>

<p>
	<strong>How can I get Subclipse to use my installed version of Subversion</strong>
</p>

<p>
	You need to select Window->Preferences->Team->SVN and select the SVN Interface type as <b>SVN Command Line</b>. 
	This assumes that the svn client (eg svn.exe) is in the path so it can be executed and the results of any commands parsed to display to inside the Eclipse Workbench.
</p>


<p>
	<strong>So if the native Subclipse bindings are tied to a Subversion version, will it be updated when a new version of Subversion comes out? </strong>
</p>

<p>
	Yes, we will try to update subclipse when a new version of Subversion comes out 
</p>

<p><strong>Will the plugin work under WSAD 5? </strong></p>

<p>
	Not currently. Subclipse uses some methods that are only supported in Eclipse 2.1 such as isLinkedResource(). It does however work under WSAD 5.1 (which uses Eclipse 2.1).
</p>

<p>
	<strong>How do I build the plugin from source?</strong>
</p>

<p>
	TODO
