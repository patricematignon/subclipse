<h1>Managing Passwords</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>As of release 0.9.100 Subclipse no longer allows you to store the username and password for your repository connection
in the connection itself.  When using the JavaHL or SVNKit adapters, you will be
prompted whenever the adapter needs your username and password.</p>

<p>As the previous screen shows, you will typically be given the option to have Subversion cache
your password.  If using the JavaHL adapter, on Windows the password will be encrypted.  See <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch06s02.html#svn-ch-6-sect-2.2">
Client Credentials Caching</a> in the Subversion book for more information.  The SVNKit adapter caches all information in the
Eclipse keyring which provides some degree of encryption.</p>
<p>The chief benefit you get by allowing the adapter to manage your password is that it will
prompt you for a new password when the password has changed, and then cache that change.  If Subclipse
is storing your password, then the adapter  will prompt you for a new password, but Subclipse will not
know that this has happened and it will keep using the old password, which means you will keep getting
prompted.  You can update the Subclipse password by invoking the Properties dialog for the stored
connection.</p>
