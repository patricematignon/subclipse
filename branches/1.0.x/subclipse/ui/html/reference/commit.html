<h1>Commit</h1>
<p>
    The commit process is initiated via the <span class="menu">Team &gt; Commit</span> menu
    option.
</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    This command commits the changes in your local <a href="glossary.html#working">working
    copy</a> to the repository.

<p>
    Enter a comment to associate with the commit or choose a previously entered
        comment from the list.
</p>
<p>
    The scope of the commit operation is relative to the resource(s) you have
        selected, and will list modified, added, deleted and unknown resources.
        All modified, added and deleted resources will be selected by default.
        Whether unversioned items are selected by default during the commit is
        determined from your SVN preferences.
</p>
<p>
	Double-clicking on a file in the list will present a compare dialog showing
	the differences between the base file and the one you are about to commit.
</p>
<p>
    To select all resources, click <span class="control">Select All</span>. Conversely,
    to deselect all resources, click <span class="control">Deselect All</span>.
</p>
<p>
    Checking the <span class="control">Keep locks</span> option will preserve
    any locks you have on repository resources.

    Your working copy must be up-to-date with respect to the resources you are
        committing. This is ensured by using <a href="update.html">Team &gt; Update</a>,
        just prior to committing, resolving conflicts and re-testing as needed,
        as described in the <a href="../dailywork/workcycle.html">typical work
        cycle</a>.
