<h3>JavaHL API Wishlist</h3>

<p>
The purpose of this page is to document enhancements to the JavaHL API that
we could use in Subclipse.  When a Subversion developer has time to work on
JavaHL they can use this as a bit of a to-do list.</p>

<div class="table">
<table>
<thead>
	<tr>
		<th>Item</th>

		<th>Developer(s)</th>

<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td nowrap>Commit Across Working Copies</td>
		<td>In the Eclipse environment the typical
		setup is that you have an Eclipse workspace which is just a folder somewhere
		and NOT a Subversion working copy.  You then do checkouts within Eclipse of
		various projects and this creates a bunch of isolated working copies within
		that workspace folder.  The problem is that JavaHL does not allow you to perform
		a single atomic commit of files from multiple projects, because the working
		copies are joined.  JavaSVN added a very nice new API that solves this problem.  We
		just give JavaSVN everything to commit, and it figures out if the files are in
		the same repository and if so, commits them in a single commit.  If not, it groups
		the commits by repository.  This is a really great feature.</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>needed</td>
		<td>N/A</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td nowrap>Peg revisions in svn log</td>
		<td>We are adding support for
		"paging" in our history view.  This can break when looking at the history
		of a branch and you request a "page" of revisions from before the branch
		creation.  With peg revision support this would work better.</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>needed</td>
		<td>N/A</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td nowrap>Network statistics</td>
		<td>Subversion 1.3 included new API support for
		reporting network statistics when using HTTP.  We could potentially
		provide better progress information if we had this.  Ideally, all ra_ 
		methods would support it though.</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>needed</td>
		<td>N/A</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td nowrap>diff --summarize</td>
		<td>I believe this feature has landed on trunk.  We could possibly use this in 
		Subclipse.  We have a lot of demand for various compare features, such as comparing
		two branches, or your working copy with a tag.  The problem is that users expect to view
		this output graphically.  We could possibly use this API to get a list of differences
		which we could then use to drive the Eclipse graphical compare engine.  Eclipse would
		do the final diffs, but the process would be more efficient if we fed it only the files
		that really are different.</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>needed</td>
		<td>N/A</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td nowrap>more support for "kind"</td>
		<td>API's that provide a list of items in the repository should always provide basic 
		information such as whether it is a folder or a file.  Some API's, such as the log API's
		do not provide this information.  It would be nice if the diff --summarize API provided it as
		well.  Subversion 1.3 (and JavaHL) added this for svn st -u which has helped.</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>needed</td>
