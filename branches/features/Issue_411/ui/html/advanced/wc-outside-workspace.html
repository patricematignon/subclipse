<h1>Using a Working Copy outside the Eclipse Workspace</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>You are already an existing Subversion user and you have a working
copy on your disk.  You want to just use that same working copy inside
Eclipse so that you do not have to maintain two copies.  Fortunately,
Subclipse and Eclipse support this scenario.  The only requirement is that
your working copy has to also be a valid Eclipse project.  This means that
it must containg an Eclipse <tt>.project</tt> file as well as any other files like the
Java <tt>.classpath</tt> file that are needed by Eclipse.  If necessary,
create a "dummy" project in Eclipse and copy the files Eclipse creates into
your working copy folder.</p>

<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p>To add the existing Eclipse project to your Eclipse workspace use the
Eclipse <b>File &gt; Import</b> menu option.</p>

<p>This will bring up the Eclipse Import dialog.</p>

<p>Select the "Existing Projects into Workspace" option and click
<b>Next</b></p>

<p>The above dialog is from Eclipse 3.1.  The dialog on Eclipse 3.0 is
a little different, mainly that you can only import one project at a time.
In this example, I have the entire Subclipse folder checked out from the Subclipse
repository to my disk.  When I select that folder, Eclipse automatically shows
all of the projects it finds in that folder.  You can select the ones that you
want to import into your workspace and click <b>Finish</b>.</p>

<p>If you are on Eclipse 3.1, after the Import completes, Subclipse should
automatically recognize the addition of these projects and connect the Subclipse
actions to the projects.  In Eclipse 3.0, you have to manually register the projects
with Subclipse.  See: <a href="../gettingstarted/share-existing.html">
Connect an Existing Project with Subclipse</a> for details.</p>

<p>This option sounds like Eclipse is going to copy the projects into
your workspace, but in actuality it only creates a pointer to the location
on disk which is what we want.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This is a great option to use if you have a need to use Subversion clients other
than Subclipse and/or you already have an existing working copy on your disk and want
to avoid the checkout process.  In the example provided above, a second benefit is that
you have a "single-rooted" working copy that contains multiple projects.  This means that
you can do an atomic commit of changes from several projects by using the Subversion command
line or another Subversion client.  We hope to be able to eventually recognize this scenario
and support it in Subclipse as well.</p>
