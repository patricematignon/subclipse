<h3>FAQ</h3>


  <p><strong>What version of Eclipse does Subclipse support
  ?</strong></p>

  <p>The current version of Subclipse supports both Eclipse 2.1.x
  and Eclipse 3.0 Line</p>

  <p><strong>Why is Subclipse so particular about what version of
  Subclipse and Berkeley DB is used?</strong></p>

  <p>Subclipse uses a JNI interface ( <a href=
  "http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/subversion/bindings/java/javahl/">
  javahl</a>) to Subversion. The binaries that come with Subclipse
  are linked with particular versions when compiled. We have also
  been developing a way to interface with the command line client
  (Windows-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Team-&gt;SVN)</p>

  <p>Keep in mind, you'll have best results with a libsvnjavahl
  built with your own system.</p>

  <p><strong>So if Subclipse is tied to a Subversion version, will
  it be updated when a new version of Subversion comes
  out?</strong></p>

  <p>Yes, we will try to update Subclipse when a new version of
  Subversion comes out</p>

  <p><strong>Why does Subclipse only support Windows?</strong></p>

  <p>Subclipse supports Windows, Linux, and OSX currently. If your
  favorite platform is missing, build us a libsvnjavahl library for
  it, and we'll add it.</p>

  <p><strong>Will the plugin work with WSAD?</strong></p>

  <p>Only WSAD 5.1 and above as this is based on Eclipse 2.1 which is a minimum requirement for Subclipse</p>

  <p><strong>Do I need Subversion installed to use
  Subclipse?</strong></p>

  <p>Not if you use Windows. If you don't use Windows, you
  <em>do</em> need Subversion and its dependencies installed.
  Currently, the jni bits (libsvnjavahl) link dynamically to the
  Subversion sources, so you may have problems if your installation
  of Subversion is out of date, or compiled agains something other
  than what we compiled against. As mentioned above, if you are
  having problems with Subclipse, we recommend rolling your own
  libsvnjavl. This is particularly true on OSX, if your Subversion
  isn't built with fink.</p>

  <p>To do this, just</p>
  <pre>
make javahl &amp;&amp; make install-javahl
</pre>
  <p>when you are making your Subversion build, and replace the
  libsvnjavahl we ship.</p>

  <p><strong>What access methods does Subclipse
  support?</strong></p>

  <p>Since Subclipse just calls out to Subversion, Subclipse can
  use any access method your command-line Subversion client can
  understand.</p>

  <p><strong>How do I get Subversion to accept my self-signed
  certificate?</strong><?p>
  </p>

  <p>There is currently no interface for this in Subclipse, but you
  can just</p>
  <pre>
svn list https://your/repo
</pre>
  <p>and opt to accept the certificate permanently. From then on,
  subclipse will also accept the certificate.</p>
