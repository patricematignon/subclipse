<h1>Team > Synchronize</h1>

<p>When you are working with complex projects in a team, it may be extremely hard to grasp the impact of your changes and interaction with 
the changes committed by others. For this, Eclipse offers the <em>Team Synchronizing Perspective</em>, which Subclipse extends to support Subversion
repositories. It can be switched to like any other perspective in Eclipse, or invoked directly by selecting 'Team > Synchronize...'</p>
<p>Note that invoking this action does not entail any changes being synchronized without your approval!</p>
<h2>Working with the Team Synchronizing Perspective</h2>
<p>Most of the documentation on synchronization in the <a href="../../../org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/reference/ref-33.htm'>main Eclipse documentation</a>
applies to Subclipse's sync support.

<h2>Synchronization compared to Subversion terminology</h2>
<p>The concept is that of a cross-resource three way merge in which you may consider all changes at once, and filter the information as
needed before doing any <em>updates</em> or <em>commits</em>, with your existing working copy being the focal point. Thus, your own changes are
called <em>outgoing</em> and the changes that have happened in the repository since your last update are called <em>incoming</em>.
In the 'sync' perspective, both incoming and outgoing changes are analyzed before they are <em>synchronized</em>, that is:
For incoming changes, synchronization means that your working copy is updated (corresponds to 'Team > Update') and for outgoing changes,
synchronization means that your changes are commited.</p>
<p>The 'Team Synchronizing Perspective' as a whole can be considered analogous to the output of <tt>svn status -u</tt>.</p>
