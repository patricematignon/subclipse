* FAQ

Why is Subclipse so particular about what version of Subclipse and
Berkley DB is used?

Subclipse uses a JNI interface (SVN-UP) to Subversion. The binaries
that come with Subclipse are linked with particular versions when
compiled. If you want to use a different version of Subversion and
Berkley DB then you'll need to change the version of the Subversion
libraries (libdb40.dll, libeay32.dll, ssleay32.dll, zlib.dll) and
recompile the SVN-UP library (good luck with that). Basically don't
bother and just upgrade your Subversion version.

So if Subclipse is tied to a Subversion version, will it be updated
when a new version of Subversion comes out?

Short answer is yes, but it will depend on the SVN-UP guys releasing
a new JNI library (which I'm sure they'de do quite quickly).

Why does Subclipse only support Windows?

It doesn't. Current supported platforms are Windows, OSX and Linux.

Will the plugin work under WSAD 5? 

Not currently. Subclipse uses some methods that are only supported
in Eclipse 2.1 such as isLinkedResource(). We'll look into supporting
it soon.
