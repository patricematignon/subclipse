<h3>Roadmap</h3>

<p>
Subclipse 1.0.0 was released on April 11, 2006.  It supports Eclipse 3.0.x through
the current 3.2.0 milestone.  The source for this release lives in the 1.0.x branch
of the repository.  Important bug fixes will be backported to this branch from trunk
and new 1.0.x releases will be made as needed.  The 1.0.x release will always maintain
Eclipse 3.0.x compatability.
</p>

<p>
Subclipse will follow an odd/even release strategy for minor releases.  The 1.1.x release
will be an "unstable" release for people that want to test the latest features.  This will
culminate in a 1.2.0 release that will be the next official "stable" release.  The 1.1.x and
1.2.x releases will require Eclipse 3.1.x as the minimum release.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the features that are planned for the 1.2.x release:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Improvements to the Console view</li>
<li>Support for Commit Sets in the Synchronize view</li>
<li>General dialog improvements, resize, keyboard accelerators etc.</li>
</ul>
