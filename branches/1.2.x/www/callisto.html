<h1 style="text-align: center;">Support for Eclipse 3.2/Callisto</h1>

<p>We are working hard on the latest version of Subclipse, which is targeted specifically at Eclipse 3.2/Callisto.
Subclipse is following the common open source odd/even release strategy where odd numbered releases are development
releases and even numbered releases are the stable user releases.  As such there is an active 1.1.x stream of development
taking place which is ultimately targeted at a 1.2.0 GA release.  This release contains a number of exciting and significant
new features that take advantage of Eclipse 3.2.  To view all of the activity, consult the changelog
<a href="subclipse_1.2.x/changes.html">here.</a></p>

<p>In general, even though the 1.1.x releases are a development release, they have been very stable and do not contain
any known bugs that are not also present in the 1.0.x release.  In addition, the release contains many Eclipse 3.2-specific
fixes and optimizations that make the release better than the 1.0.x release.  As such, we would highly recommend installing the
1.1.x release if you are using Eclipse 3.2.  If you are concerned about stability, we would recommend just reviewing the changelog
when new 1.1.x releases are issued and maybe wait a few days before installing them.  We generally fix serious bugs that are found
in a very short time frame.  Again, these releases are very stable and are close to the 1.2.0 stage.  We are mainly waiting for
the Subversion 1.4.0 GA release so that we can include the binaries from that release.</p>

<p>To install the 1.1.x release, follow the standard install instructions but substitute an update site URL of:</p>
<pre>
   http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.2.x
</pre>
<p>Detailed installation instructions for Subclipse 
can be found on the page <a href="install.html">Installation Instructions</a>.  Until the 1.2.0 release is official, we will only
be making available new releases via the update site.  Zipped distributions will be made available once 1.2.0 is official.
